interpreter.\\n\\n\"...\"\\n   can refer to:\\n\\n   * the default python prompt of the interactive shell when entering\\n     the code for an indented code block, when within a pair of\\n     matching left and right delimiters (parentheses, square brackets,\\n     curly braces or triple quotes), or after specifying a decorator.\\n\\n   * the \"ellipsis\" built-in constant.\\n\\n2to3\\n   a tool that tries to convert python 2.x code to python 3.x code by\\n   handling most of the incompatibilities which can be detected by\\n   parsing the source and traversing the parse tree.\\n\\n   2to3 is available in the standard library as \"lib2to3\"; a\\n   standalone entry point is provided as \"tools/scripts/2to3\".  see\\n   2to3 - automated python 2 to 3 code translation.\\n\\nabstract base class\\n   abstract base classes complement *duck-typing* by providing a way\\n   to define interfaces when other techniques like \"hasattr()\" would\\n   be clumsy or subtly wrong (for example with magic methods).  abcs\\n   introduce virtual subclasses, which are classes that don\\'t inherit\\n   from a class but are still recognized by \"isinstance()\" and\\n   \"issubclass()\"; see the \"abc\" module documentation.  python comes\\n   with many built-in abcs for data structures (in the\\n   \"collections.abc\" module), numbers (in the \"numbers\" module),\\n   streams (in the \"io\" module), import finders and loaders (in the\\n   \"importlib.abc\" module).  you can create your own abcs with the\\n   \"abc\" module.\\n\\nannotation\\n   a label associated with a variable, a class attribute or a function\\n   parameter or return value, used by convention as a *type hint*.\\n\\n   annotations of local variables cannot be accessed at runtime, but\\n   annotations of global variables, class attributes, and functions\\n   are stored in the \"__annotations__\" special attribute of modules,\\n   classes, and functions, respectively.\\n\\n   see *variable annotation*, *function annotation*, **pep 484** and\\n   **pep 526**, which describe this functionality. also see\\n   annotations best practices for best practices on working with\\n   annotations.\\n\\nargument\\n   a value passed to a *function* (or *method*) when calling the\\n   function.  there are two kinds of argument:\\n\\n   * *keyword argument*: an argument preceded by an identifier (e.g.\\n     \"name=\") in a function call or passed as a value in a dictionary\\n     preceded by \"**\".  for example, \"3\" and \"5\" are both keyword\\n     arguments in the following calls to \"complex()\":\\n\\n        complex(real=3, imag=5)\\n        complex(**{\\'real\\': 3, \\'imag\\': 5})\\n\\n   * *positional argument*: an argument that is not a keyword\\n     argument. positional arguments can appear at the beginning of an\\n     argument list and/or be passed as elements of an *iterable*\\n     preceded by \"*\". for example, \"3\" and \"5\" are both positional\\n     arguments in the following calls:\\n\\n        complex(3, 5)\\n        complex(*(3, 5))\\n\\n   arguments are assigned to the named local variables in a function\\n   body. see the calls section for the rules governing this\\n   assignment. syntactically, any expression can be used to represent\\n   an argument; the evaluated value is assigned to the local variable.\\n\\n   see also the *parameter* glossary entry, the faq question on the\\n   difference between arguments and parameters, and **pep 362**.\\n\\nasynchronous context manager\\n   an object which controls the environment seen in an \"async with\"\\n   statement by defining \"__aenter__()\" and \"__aexit__()\" methods.\\n   introduced by **pep 492**.\\n\\nasynchronous generator\\n   a function which returns an *asynchronous generator iterator*.  it\\n   looks like a coroutine function defined with \"async def\" except\\n   that it contains \"yield\" expressions for producing a series of\\n   values usable in an \"async for\" loop.\\n\\n   usually refers to an asynchronous generator function, but may refer\\n   to an *asynchronous generator iterator* in some contexts.  in cases\\n   where the intended meaning isn\\'t clear, using the full terms avoids\\n   ambiguity.\\n\\n   an asynchronous generator function may contain \"await\" expressions\\n   as well as \"async for\", and \"async with\" statements.\\n\\nasynchronous generator iterator\\n   an object created by a *asynchronous generator* function.\\n\\n   this is an *asynchronous iterator* which when called using the\\n   \"__anext__()\" method returns an awaitable object which will execute\\n   the body of the asynchronous generator function until the next\\n   \"yield\" expression.\\n\\n   each \"yield\" temporarily suspends processing, remembering the\\n   location execution state (including local variables and pending\\n   try-statements).  when the *asynchronous generator iterator*\\n   effectively resumes with another awaitable returned by\\n   \"__anext__()\", it picks up where it left off.  see **pep 492** and\\n   **pep 525**.\\n\\nasynchronous iterable\\n   an object, that can be used in an \"async for\" statement. must\\n   return an *asynchronous iterator* from its \"__aiter__()\" method.\\n   introduced by **pep 492**.\\n\\nasynchronous iterator\\n   an object that implements the \"__aiter__()\" and \"__anext__()\"\\n   methods.  \"__anext__\" must return an *awaitable* object. \"async\\n   for\" resolves the awaitables returned by an asynchronous iterator\\'s\\n   \"__anext__()\" method until it raises a \"stopasynciteration\"\\n   exception.  introduced by **pep 492**.\\n\\nattribute\\n   a value associated with an object which is referenced by name using\\n   dotted expressions.  for example, if an object *o* has an attribute\\n   *a* it would be referenced as *o.a*.\\n\\nawaitable\\n   an object that can be used in an \"await\" expression.  can be a\\n   *coroutine* or an object with an \"__await__()\" method. see also\\n   **pep 492**.\\n\\nbdfl\\n   benevolent dictator for life, a.k.a. guido van rossum, python\\'s\\n   creator.\\n\\nbinary file\\n   a *file object* able to read and write *bytes-like objects*.\\n   examples of binary files are files opened in binary mode (\"\\'rb\\'\",\\n   \"\\'wb\\'\" or \"\\'rb+\\'\"), \"sys.stdin.buffer\", \"sys.stdout.buffer\", and\\n   instances of \"io.bytesio\" and \"gzip.gzipfile\".\\n\\n   see also *text file* for a file object able to read and write \"str\"\\n   objects.\\n\\nborrowed reference\\n   in python\\'s c api, a borrowed reference is a reference to an\\n   object. it does not modify the object reference count. it becomes a\\n   dangling pointer if the object is destroyed. for example, a garbage\\n   collection can remove the last *strong reference* to the object and\\n   so destroy it.\\n\\n   calling \"py_incref()\" on the *borrowed reference* is recommended to\\n   convert it to a *strong reference* in-place, except when the object\\n   cannot be destroyed before the last usage of the borrowed\\n   reference. the \"py_newref()\" function can be used to create a new\\n   *strong reference*.\\n\\nbytes-like object\\n   an object that supports the buffer protocol and can export a\\n   c-*contiguous* buffer. this includes all \"bytes\", \"bytearray\", and\\n   \"array.array\" objects, as well as many common \"memoryview\" objects.\\n   bytes-like objects can be used for various operations that work\\n   with binary data; these include compression, saving to a binary\\n   file, and sending over a socket.\\n\\n   some operations need the binary data to be mutable.  the\\n   documentation often refers to these as \"read-write bytes-like\\n   objects\".  example mutable buffer objects include \"bytearray\" and a\\n   \"memoryview\" of a \"bytearray\". other operations require the binary\\n   data to be stored in immutable objects (\"read-only bytes-like\\n   objects\"); examples of these include \"bytes\" and a \"memoryview\" of\\n   a \"bytes\" object.\\n\\nbytecode\\n   python source code is compiled into bytecode, the internal\\n   representation of a python program in the cpython interpreter.  the\\n   bytecode is also cached in \".pyc\" files so that executing the same\\n   file is faster the second time (recompilation from source to\\n   bytecode can be avoided).  this \"intermediate language\" is said to\\n   run on a *virtual machine* that executes the machine code\\n   corresponding to each bytecode. do note that bytecodes are not\\n   expected to work between different python virtual machines, nor to\\n   be stable between python releases.\\n\\n   a list of bytecode instructions can be found in the documentation\\n   for the dis module.\\n\\ncallback\\n   a subroutine function which is passed as an argument to be executed\\n   at some point in the future.\\n\\nclass\\n   a template for creating user-defined objects. class definitions\\n   normally contain method definitions which operate on instances of\\n   the class.\\n\\nclass variable\\n   a variable defined in a class and intended to be modified only at\\n   class level (i.e., not in an instance of the class).\\n\\ncoercion\\n   the implicit conversion of an instance of one type to another\\n   during an operation which involves two arguments of the same type.\\n   for example, \"int(3.15)\" converts the floating point number to the\\n   integer \"3\", but in \"3+4.5\", each argument is of a different type\\n   (one int, one float), and both must be converted to the same type\\n   before they can be added or it will raise a \"typeerror\".  without\\n   coercion, all arguments of even compatible types would have to be\\n   normalized to the same value by the programmer, e.g.,\\n   \"float(3)+4.5\" rather than just \"3+4.5\".\\n\\ncomplex number\\n   an extension of the familiar real number system in which all\\n   numbers are expressed as a sum of a real part and an imaginary\\n   part.  imaginary numbers are real multiples of the imaginary unit\\n   (the square root of \"-1\"), often written \"i\" in mathematics or \"j\"\\n   in engineering.  python has built-in support for complex numbers,\\n   which are written with this latter notation; the imaginary part is\\n   written with a \"j\" suffix, e.g., \"3+1j\".  to get access to complex\\n   equivalents of the \"math\" module, use \"cmath\".  use of complex\\n   numbers is a fairly advanced mathematical feature.  if you\\'re not\\n   aware of a need for them, it\\'s almost certain you can safely ignore\\n   them.\\n\\ncontext manager\\n   an object which controls the environment seen in a \"with\" statement\\n   by defining \"__enter__()\" and \"__exit__()\" methods. see **pep\\n   343**.\\n\\ncontext variable\\n   a variable which can have different values depending on its\\n   context. this is similar to thread-local storage in which each\\n   execution thread may have a different value for a variable.\\n   however, with context variables, there may be several contexts in\\n   one execution thread and the main usage for context variables is to\\n   keep track of variables in concurrent asynchronous tasks. see\\n   \"contextvars\".\\n\\ncontiguous\\n   a buffer is considered contiguous exactly if it is either\\n   *c-contiguous* or *fortran contiguous*.  zero-dimensional buffers\\n   are c and fortran contiguous.  in one-dimensional arrays, the items\\n   must be laid out in memory next to each other, in order of\\n   increasing indexes starting from zero.  in multidimensional\\n   c-contiguous arrays, the last index varies the fastest when\\n   visiting items in order of memory address.  however, in fortran\\n   contiguous arrays, the first index varies the fastest.\\n\\ncoroutine\\n   coroutines are a more generalized form of subroutines. subroutines\\n   are entered at one point and exited at another point.  coroutines\\n   can be entered, exited, and resumed at many different points.  they\\n   can be implemented with the \"async def\" statement.  see also **pep\\n   492**.\\n\\ncoroutine function\\n   a function which returns a *coroutine* object.  a coroutine\\n   function may be defined with the \"async def\" statement, and may\\n   contain \"await\", \"async for\", and \"async with\" keywords.  these\\n   were introduced by **pep 492**.\\n\\ncpython\\n   the canonical implementation of the python programming language, as\\n   distributed on python.org.  the term \"cpython\" is used when\\n   necessary to distinguish this implementation from others such as\\n   jython or ironpython.\\n\\ndecorator\\n   a function returning another function, usually applied as a\\n   function transformation using the \"@wrapper\" syntax.  common\\n   examples for decorators are \"classmethod()\" and \"staticmethod()\".\\n\\n   the decorator syntax is merely syntactic sugar, the following two\\n   function definitions are semantically equivalent:\\n\\n      def f(arg):\\n          ...\\n      f = staticmethod(f)\\n\\n      @staticmethod\\n      def f(arg):\\n          ...\\n\\n   the same concept exists for classes, but is less commonly used\\n   there.  see the documentation for function definitions and class\\n   definitions for more about decorators.\\n\\ndescriptor\\n   any object which defines the methods \"__get__()\", \"__set__()\", or\\n   \"__delete__()\".  when a class attribute is a descriptor, its\\n   special binding behavior is triggered upon attribute lookup.\\n   normally, using *a.b* to get, set or delete an attribute looks up\\n   the object named *b* in the class dictionary for *a*, but if *b* is\\n   a descriptor, the respective descriptor method gets called.\\n   understanding descriptors is a key to a deep understanding of\\n   python because they are the basis for many features including\\n   functions, methods, properties, class methods, static methods, and\\n   reference to super classes.\\n\\n   for more information about descriptors\\' methods, see implementing\\n   descriptors or the descriptor how to guide.\\n\\ndictionary\\n   an associative array, where arbitrary keys are mapped to values.\\n   the keys can be any object with \"__hash__()\" and \"__eq__()\"\\n   methods. called a hash in perl.\\n\\ndictionary comprehension\\n   a compact way to process all or part of the elements in an iterable\\n   and return a dictionary with the results. \"results = {n: n ** 2 for\\n   n in range(10)}\" generates a dictionary containing key \"n\" mapped\\n   to value \"n ** 2\". see displays for lists, sets and dictionaries.\\n\\ndictionary view\\n   the objects returned from \"dict.keys()\", \"dict.values()\", and\\n   \"dict.items()\" are called dictionary views. they provide a dynamic\\n   view on the dictionary’s entries, which means that when the\\n   dictionary changes, the view reflects these changes. to force the\\n   dictionary view to become a full list use \"list(dictview)\".  see\\n   dictionary view objects.\\n\\ndocstring\\n   a string literal which appears as the first expression in a class,\\n   function or module.  while ignored when the suite is executed, it\\n   is recognized by the compiler and put into the \"__doc__\" attribute\\n   of the enclosing class, function or module.  since it is available\\n   via introspection, it is the canonical place for documentation of\\n   the object.\\n\\nduck-typing\\n   a programming style which does not look at an object\\'s type to\\n   determine if it has the right interface; instead, the method or\\n   attribute is simply called or used (\"if it looks like a duck and\\n   quacks like a duck, it must be a duck.\")  by emphasizing interfaces\\n   rather than specific types, well-designed code improves its\\n   flexibility by allowing polymorphic substitution.  duck-typing\\n   avoids tests using \"type()\" or \"isinstance()\".  (note, however,\\n   that duck-typing can be complemented with *abstract base classes*.)\\n   instead, it typically employs \"hasattr()\" tests or *eafp*\\n   programming.\\n\\neafp\\n   easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.  this common python\\n   coding style assumes the existence of valid keys or attributes and\\n   catches exceptions if the assumption proves false.  this clean and\\n   fast style is characterized by the presence of many \"try\" and\\n   \"except\" statements.  the technique contrasts with the *lbyl* style\\n   common to many other languages such as c.\\n\\nexpression\\n   a piece of syntax which can be evaluated to some value.  in other\\n   words, an expression is an accumulation of expression elements like\\n   literals, names, attribute access, operators or function calls\\n   which all return a value.  in contrast to many other languages, not\\n   all language constructs are expressions.  there are also\\n   *statement*s which cannot be used as expressions, such as \"while\".\\n   assignments are also statements, not expressions.\\n\\nextension module\\n   a module written in c or c++, using python\\'s c api to interact with\\n   the core and with user code.\\n\\nf-string\\n   string literals prefixed with \"\\'f\\'\" or \"\\'f\\'\" are commonly called\\n   \"f-strings\" which is short for formatted string literals.  see also\\n   **pep 498**.\\n\\nfile object\\n   an object exposing a file-oriented api (with methods such as\\n   \"read()\" or \"write()\") to an underlying resource.  depending on the\\n   way it was created, a file object can mediate access to a real on-\\n   disk file or to another type of storage or communication device\\n   (for example standard input/output, in-memory buffers, sockets,\\n   pipes, etc.).  file objects are also called *file-like objects* or\\n   *streams*.\\n\\n   there are actually three categories of file objects: raw *binary\\n   files*, buffered *binary files* and *text files*. their interfaces\\n   are defined in the \"io\" module.  the canonical way to create a file\\n   object is by using the \"open()\" function.\\n\\nfile-like object\\n   a synonym for *file object*.\\n\\nfilesystem encoding and error handler\\n   encoding and error handler used by python to decode bytes from the\\n   operating system and encode unicode to the operating system.\\n\\n   the filesystem encoding must guarantee to successfully decode all\\n   bytes below 128. if the file system encoding fails to provide this\\n   guarantee, api functions can raise \"unicodeerror\".\\n\\n   the \"sys.getfilesystemencoding()\" and\\n   \"sys.getfilesystemencodeerrors()\" functions can be used to get the\\n   filesystem encoding and error handler.\\n\\n   the *filesystem encoding and error handler* are configured at\\n   python startup by the \"pyconfig_read()\" function: see\\n   \"filesystem_encoding\" and \"filesystem_errors\" members of\\n   \"pyconfig\".\\n\\n   see also the *locale encoding*.\\n\\nfinder\\n   an object that tries to find the *loader* for a module that is\\n   being imported.\\n\\n   since python 3.3, there are two types of finder: *meta path\\n   finders* for use with \"sys.meta_path\", and *path entry finders* for\\n   use with \"sys.path_hooks\".\\n\\n   see **pep 302**, **pep 420** and **pep 451** for much more detail.\\n\\nfloor division\\n   mathematical division that rounds down to nearest integer.  the\\n   floor division operator is \"//\".  for example, the expression \"11\\n   // 4\" evaluates to \"2\" in contrast to the \"2.75\" returned by float\\n   true division.  note that \"(-11) // 4\" is \"-3\" because that is\\n   \"-2.75\" rounded *downward*. see **pep 238**.\\n\\nfunction\\n   a series of statements which returns some value to a caller. it can\\n   also be passed zero or more *arguments* which may be used in the\\n   execution of the body. see also *parameter*, *method*, and the\\n   function definitions section.\\n\\nfunction annotation\\n   an *annotation* of a function parameter or return value.\\n\\n   function annotations are usually used for *type hints*: for\\n   example, this function is expected to take two \"int\" arguments and\\n   is also expected to have an \"int\" return value:\\n\\n      def sum_two_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:\\n         return a + b\\n\\n   function annotation syntax is explained in section function\\n   definitions.\\n\\n   see *variable annotation* and **pep 484**, which describe this\\n   functionality. also see annotations best practices for best\\n   practices on working with annotations.\\n\\n__future__\\n   a future statement, \"from __future__ import <feature>\", directs the\\n   compiler to compile the current module using syntax or semantics\\n   that will become standard in a future release of python. the\\n   \"__future__\" module documents the possible values of *feature*.  by\\n   importing this module and evaluating its variables, you can see\\n   when a new feature was first added to the language and when it will\\n   (or did) become the default:\\n\\n      >>> import __future__\\n      >>> __future__.division\\n      _feature((2, 2, 0, \\'alpha\\', 2), (3, 0, 0, \\'alpha\\', 0), 8192)\\n\\ngarbage collection\\n   the process of freeing memory when it is not used anymore.  python\\n   performs garbage collection via reference counting and a cyclic\\n   garbage collector that is able to detect and break reference\\n   cycles.  the garbage collector can be controlled using the \"gc\"\\n   module.\\n\\ngenerator\\n   a function which returns a *generator iterator*.  it looks like a\\n   normal function except that it contains \"yield\" expressions for\\n   producing a series of values usable in a for-loop or that can be\\n   retrieved one at a time with the \"next()\" function.\\n\\n   usually refers to a generator function, but may refer to a\\n   *generator iterator* in some contexts.  in cases where the intended\\n   meaning isn\\'t clear, using the full terms avoids ambiguity.\\n\\ngenerator iterator\\n   an object created by a *generator* function.\\n\\n   each \"yield\" temporarily suspends processing, remembering the\\n   location execution state (including local variables and pending\\n   try-statements).  when the *generator iterator* resumes, it picks\\n   up where it left off (in contrast to functions which start fresh on\\n   every invocation).\\n\\ngenerator expression\\n   an expression that returns an iterator.  it looks like a normal\\n   expression followed by a \"for\" clause defining a loop variable,\\n   range, and an optional \"if\" clause.  the combined expression\\n   generates values for an enclosing function:\\n\\n      >>> sum(i*i for i in range(10))         # sum of squares 0, 1, 4, ... 81\\n      285\\n\\ngeneric function\\n   a function composed of multiple functions implementing the same\\n   operation for different types. which implementation should be used\\n   during a call is determined by the dispatch algorithm.\\n\\n   see also the *single dispatch* glossary entry, the\\n   \"functools.singledispatch()\" decorator, and **pep 443**.\\n\\ngeneric type\\n   a *type* that can be parameterized; typically a container class\\n   such as \"list\" or \"dict\". used for *type hints* and *annotations*.\\n\\n   for more details, see generic alias types, **pep 483**, **pep\\n   484**, **pep 585**, and the \"typing\" module.\\n\\ngil\\n   see *global interpreter lock*.\\n\\nglobal interpreter lock\\n   the mechanism used by the *cpython* interpreter to assure that only\\n   one thread executes python *bytecode* at a time. this simplifies\\n   the cpython implementation by making the object model (including\\n   critical built-in types such as \"dict\") implicitly safe against\\n   concurrent access.  locking the entire interpreter makes it easier\\n   for the interpreter to be multi-threaded, at the expense of much of\\n   the parallelism afforded by multi-processor machines.\\n\\n   however, some extension modules, either standard or third-party,\\n   are designed so as to release the gil when doing computationally-\\n   intensive tasks such as compression or hashing.  also, the gil is\\n   always released when doing i/o.\\n\\n   past efforts to create a \"free-threaded\" interpreter (one which\\n   locks shared data at a much finer granularity) have not been\\n   successful because performance suffered in the common single-\\n   processor case. it is believed that overcoming this performance\\n   issue would make the implementation much more complicated and\\n   therefore costlier to maintain.\\n\\nhash-based pyc\\n   a bytecode cache file that uses the hash rather than the last-\\n   modified time of the corresponding source file to determine its\\n   validity. see cached bytecode invalidation.\\n\\nhashable\\n   an object is *hashable* if it has a hash value which never changes\\n   during its lifetime (it needs a \"__hash__()\" method), and can be\\n   compared to other objects (it needs an \"__eq__()\" method).\\n   hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value.\\n\\n   hashability makes an object usable as a dictionary key and a set\\n   member, because these data structures use the hash value\\n   internally.\\n\\n   most of python\\'s immutable built-in objects are hashable; mutable\\n   containers (such as lists or dictionaries) are not; immutable\\n   containers (such as tuples and frozensets) are only hashable if\\n   their elements are hashable.  objects which are instances of user-\\n   defined classes are hashable by default.  they all compare unequal\\n   (except with themselves), and their hash value is derived from\\n   their \"id()\".\\n\\nidle\\n   an integrated development environment for python.  idle is a basic\\n   editor and interpreter environment which ships with the standard\\n   distribution of python.\\n\\nimmutable\\n   an object with a fixed value.  immutable objects include numbers,\\n   strings and tuples.  such an object cannot be altered.  a new\\n   object has to be created if a different value has to be stored.\\n   they play an important role in places where a constant hash value\\n   is needed, for example as a key in a dictionary.\\n\\nimport path\\n   a list of locations (or *path entries*) that are searched by the\\n   *path based finder* for modules to import. during import, this list\\n   of locations usually comes from \"sys.path\", but for subpackages it\\n   may also come from the parent package\\'s \"__path__\" attribute.\\n\\nimporting\\n   the process by which python code in one module is made available to\\n   python code in another module.\\n\\nimporter\\n   an object that both finds and loads a module; both a *finder* and\\n   *loader* object.\\n\\ninteractive\\n   python has an interactive interpreter which means you can enter\\n   statements and expressions at the interpreter prompt, immediately\\n   execute them and see their results.  just launch \"python\" with no\\n   arguments (possibly by selecting it from your computer\\'s main\\n   menu). it is a very powerful way to test out new ideas or inspect\\n   modules and packages (remember \"help(x)\").\\n\\ninterpreted\\n   python is an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled one,\\n   though the distinction can be blurry because of the presence of the\\n   bytecode compiler.  this means that source files can be run\\n   directly without explicitly creating an executable which is then\\n   run. interpreted languages typically have a shorter\\n   development/debug cycle than compiled ones, though their programs\\n   generally also run more slowly.  see also *interactive*.\\n\\ninterpreter shutdown\\n   when asked to shut down, the python interpreter enters a special\\n   phase where it gradually releases all allocated resources, such as\\n   modules and various critical internal structures.  it also makes\\n   several calls to the *garbage collector*. this can trigger the\\n   execution of code in user-defined destructors or weakref callbacks.\\n   code executed during the shutdown phase can encounter various\\n   exceptions as the resources it relies on may not function anymore\\n   (common examples are library modules or the warnings machinery).\\n\\n   the main reason for interpreter shutdown is that the \"__main__\"\\n   module or the script being run has finished executing.\\n\\niterable\\n   an object capable of returning its members one at a time. examples\\n   of iterables include all sequence types (such as \"list\", \"str\", and\\n   \"tuple\") and some non-sequence types like \"dict\", *file objects*,\\n   and objects of any classes you define with an \"__iter__()\" method\\n   or with a \"__getitem__()\" method that implements *sequence*\\n   semantics.\\n\\n   iterables can be used in a \"for\" loop and in many other places\\n   where a sequence is needed (\"zip()\", \"map()\", ...).  when an\\n   iterable object is passed as an argument to the built-in function\\n   \"iter()\", it returns an iterator for the object.  this iterator is\\n   good for one pass over the set of values.  when using iterables, it\\n   is usually not necessary to call \"iter()\" or deal with iterator\\n   objects yourself.  the \"for\" statement does that automatically for\\n   you, creating a temporary unnamed variable to hold the iterator for\\n   the duration of the loop.  see also *iterator*, *sequence*, and\\n   *generator*.\\n\\niterator\\n   an object representing a stream of data.  repeated calls to the\\n   iterator\\'s \"__next__()\" method (or passing it to the built-in\\n   function \"next()\") return successive items in the stream.  when no\\n   more data are available a \"stopiteration\" exception is raised\\n   instead.  at this point, the iterator object is exhausted and any\\n   further calls to its \"__next__()\" method just raise \"stopiteration\"\\n   again.  iterators are required to have an \"__iter__()\" method that\\n   returns the iterator object itself so every iterator is also\\n   iterable and may be used in most places where other iterables are\\n   accepted.  one notable exception is code which attempts multiple\\n   iteration passes.  a container object (such as a \"list\") produces a\\n   fresh new iterator each time you pass it to the \"iter()\" function\\n   or use it in a \"for\" loop.  attempting this with an iterator will\\n   just return the same exhausted iterator object used in the previous\\n   iteration pass, making it appear like an empty container.\\n\\n   more information can be found in iterator types.\\n\\n   **cpython implementation detail:** cpython does not consistently\\n   apply the requirement that an iterator define \"__iter__()\".\\n\\nkey function\\n   a key function or collation function is a callable that returns a\\n   value used for sorting or ordering.  for example,\\n   \"locale.strxfrm()\" is used to produce a sort key that is aware of\\n   locale specific sort conventions.\\n\\n   a number of tools in python accept key functions to control how\\n   elements are ordered or grouped.  they include \"min()\", \"max()\",\\n   \"sorted()\", \"list.sort()\", \"heapq.merge()\", \"heapq.nsmallest()\",\\n   \"heapq.nlargest()\", and \"itertools.groupby()\".\\n\\n   there are several ways to create a key function.  for example. the\\n   \"str.lower()\" method can serve as a key function for case\\n   insensitive sorts.  alternatively, a key function can be built from\\n   a \"lambda\" expression such as \"lambda r: (r[0], r[2])\".  also, the\\n   \"operator\" module provides three key function constructors:\\n   \"attrgetter()\", \"itemgetter()\", and \"methodcaller()\".  see the\\n   sorting how to for examples of how to create and use key functions.\\n\\nkeyword argument\\n   see *argument*.\\n\\nlambda\\n   an anonymous inline function consisting of a single *expression*\\n   which is evaluated when the function is called.  the syntax to\\n   create a lambda function is \"lambda [parameters]: expression\"\\n\\nlbyl\\n   look before you leap.  this coding style explicitly tests for pre-\\n   conditions before making calls or lookups.  this style contrasts\\n   with the *eafp* approach and is characterized by the presence of\\n   many \"if\" statements.\\n\\n   in a multi-threaded environment, the lbyl approach can risk\\n   introducing a race condition between \"the looking\" and \"the\\n   leaping\".  for example, the code, \"if key in mapping: return\\n   mapping[key]\" can fail if another thread removes *key* from\\n   *mapping* after the test, but before the lookup. this issue can be\\n   solved with locks or by using the eafp approach.\\n\\nlocale encoding\\n   on unix, it is the encoding of the lc_ctype locale. it can be set\\n   with \"locale.setlocale(locale.lc_ctype, new_locale)\".\\n\\n   on windows, it is the ansi code page (ex: \"cp1252\").\\n\\n   \"locale.getpreferredencoding(false)\" can be used to get the locale\\n   encoding.\\n\\n   python uses the *filesystem encoding and error handler* to convert\\n   between unicode filenames and bytes filenames.\\n\\nlist\\n   a built-in python *sequence*.  despite its name it is more akin to\\n   an array in other languages than to a linked list since access to\\n   elements is o(1).\\n\\nlist comprehension\\n   a compact way to process all or part of the elements in a sequence\\n   and return a list with the results.  \"result = [\\'{:#04x}\\'.format(x)\\n   for x in range(256) if x % 2 == 0]\" generates a list of strings\\n   containing even hex numbers (0x..) in the range from 0 to 255. the\\n   \"if\" clause is optional.  if omitted, all elements in \"range(256)\"\\n   are processed.\\n\\nloader\\n   an object that loads a module. it must define a method named\\n   \"load_module()\". a loader is typically returned by a *finder*. see\\n   **pep 302** for details and \"importlib.abc.loader\" for an *abstract\\n   base class*.\\n\\nmagic method\\n   an informal synonym for *special method*.\\n\\nmapping\\n   a container object that supports arbitrary key lookups and\\n   implements the methods specified in the \"mapping\" or\\n   \"mutablemapping\" abstract base classes.  examples include \"dict\",\\n   \"collections.defaultdict\", \"collections.ordereddict\" and\\n   \"collections.counter\".\\n\\nmeta path finder\\n   a *finder* returned by a search of \"sys.meta_path\".  meta path\\n   finders are related to, but different from *path entry finders*.\\n\\n   see \"importlib.abc.metapathfinder\" for the methods that meta path\\n   finders implement.\\n\\nmetaclass\\n   the class of a class.  class definitions create a class name, a\\n   class dictionary, and a list of base classes.  the metaclass is\\n   responsible for taking those three arguments and creating the\\n   class.  most object oriented programming languages provide a\\n   default implementation.  what makes python special is that it is\\n   possible to create custom metaclasses.  most users never need this\\n   tool, but when the need arises, metaclasses can provide powerful,\\n   elegant solutions.  they have been used for logging attribute\\n   access, adding thread-safety, tracking object creation,\\n   implementing singletons, and many other tasks.\\n\\n   more information can be found in metaclasses.\\n\\nmethod\\n   a function which is defined inside a class body.  if called as an\\n   attribute of an instance of that class, the method will get the\\n   instance object as its first *argument* (which is usually called\\n   \"self\"). see *function* and *nested scope*.\\n\\nmethod resolution order\\n   method resolution order is the order in which base classes are\\n   searched for a member during lookup. see the python 2.3 method\\n   resolution order for details of the algorithm used by the python\\n   interpreter since the 2.3 release.\\n\\nmodule\\n   an object that serves as an organizational unit of python code.\\n   modules have a namespace containing arbitrary python objects.\\n   modules are loaded into python by the process of *importing*.\\n\\n   see also *package*.\\n\\nmodule spec\\n   a namespace containing the import-related information used to load\\n   a module. an instance of \"importlib.machinery.modulespec\".\\n\\nmro\\n   see *method resolution order*.\\n\\nmutable\\n   mutable objects can change their value but keep their \"id()\".  see\\n   also *immutable*.\\n\\nnamed tuple\\n   the term \"named tuple\" applies to any type or class that inherits\\n   from tuple and whose indexable elements are also accessible using\\n   named attributes.  the type or class may have other features as\\n   well.\\n\\n   several built-in types are named tuples, including the values\\n   returned by \"time.localtime()\" and \"os.stat()\".  another example is\\n   \"sys.float_info\":\\n\\n      >>> sys.float_info[1]                   # indexed access\\n      1024\\n      >>> sys.float_info.max_exp              # named field access\\n      1024\\n      >>> isinstance(sys.float_info, tuple)   # kind of tuple\\n      true\\n\\n   some named tuples are built-in types (such as the above examples).\\n   alternatively, a named tuple can be created from a regular class\\n   definition that inherits from \"tuple\" and that defines named\\n   fields.  such a class can be written by hand or it can be created\\n   with the factory function \"collections.namedtuple()\".  the latter\\n   technique also adds some extra methods that may not be found in\\n   hand-written or built-in named tuples.\\n\\nnamespace\\n   the place where a variable is stored.  namespaces are implemented\\n   as dictionaries.  there are the local, global and built-in\\n   namespaces as well as nested namespaces in objects (in methods).\\n   namespaces support modularity by preventing naming conflicts.  for\\n   instance, the functions \"builtins.open\" and \"os.open()\" are\\n   distinguished by their namespaces.  namespaces also aid readability\\n   and maintainability by making it clear which module implements a\\n   function.  for instance, writing \"random.seed()\" or\\n   \"itertools.islice()\" makes it clear that those functions are\\n   implemented by the \"random\" and \"itertools\" modules, respectively.\\n\\nnamespace package\\n   a **pep 420** *package* which serves only as a container for\\n   subpackages.  namespace packages may have no physical\\n   representation, and specifically are not like a *regular package*\\n   because they have no \"__init__.py\" file.\\n\\n   see also *module*.\\n\\nnested scope\\n   the ability to refer to a variable in an enclosing definition.  for\\n   instance, a function defined inside another function can refer to\\n   variables in the outer function.  note that nested scopes by\\n   default work only for reference and not for assignment.  local\\n   variables both read and write in the innermost scope.  likewise,\\n   global variables read and write to the global namespace.  the\\n   \"nonlocal\" allows writing to outer scopes.\\n\\nnew-style class\\n   old name for the flavor of classes now used for all class objects.\\n   in earlier python versions, only new-style classes could use\\n   python\\'s newer, versatile features like \"__slots__\", descriptors,\\n   properties, \"__getattribute__()\", class methods, and static\\n   methods.\\n\\nobject\\n   any data with state (attributes or value) and defined behavior\\n   (methods).  also the ultimate base class of any *new-style class*.\\n\\npackage\\n   a python *module* which can contain submodules or recursively,\\n   subpackages.  technically, a package is a python module with an\\n   \"__path__\" attribute.\\n\\n   see also *regular package* and *namespace package*.\\n\\nparameter\\n   a named entity in a *function* (or method) definition that\\n   specifies an *argument* (or in some cases, arguments) that the\\n   function can accept.  there are five kinds of parameter:\\n\\n   * *positional-or-keyword*: specifies an argument that can be passed\\n     either *positionally* or as a *keyword argument*.  this is the\\n     default kind of parameter, for example *foo* and *bar* in the\\n     following:\\n\\n        def func(foo, bar=none): ...\\n\\n   * *positional-only*: specifies an argument that can be supplied\\n     only by position. positional-only parameters can be defined by\\n     including a \"/\" character in the parameter list of the function\\n     definition after them, for example *posonly1* and *posonly2* in\\n     the following:\\n\\n        def func(posonly1, posonly2, /, positional_or_keyword): ...\\n\\n   * *keyword-only*: specifies an argument that can be supplied only\\n     by keyword.  keyword-only parameters can be defined by including\\n     a single var-positional parameter or bare \"*\" in the parameter\\n     list of the function definition before them, for example\\n     *kw_only1* and *kw_only2* in the following:\\n\\n        def func(arg, *, kw_only1, kw_only2): ...\\n\\n   * *var-positional*: specifies that an arbitrary sequence of\\n     positional arguments can be provided (in addition to any\\n     positional arguments already accepted by other parameters).  such\\n     a parameter can be defined by prepending the parameter name with\\n     \"*\", for example *args* in the following:\\n\\n        def func(*args, **kwargs): ...\\n\\n   * *var-keyword*: specifies that arbitrarily many keyword arguments\\n     can be provided (in addition to any keyword arguments already\\n     accepted by other parameters).  such a parameter can be defined\\n     by prepending the parameter name with \"**\", for example *kwargs*\\n     in the example above.\\n\\n   parameters can specify both optional and required arguments, as\\n   well as default values for some optional arguments.\\n\\n   see also the *argument* glossary entry, the faq question on the\\n   difference between arguments and parameters, the\\n   \"inspect.parameter\" class, the function definitions section, and\\n   **pep 362**.\\n\\npath entry\\n   a single location on the *import path* which the *path based\\n   finder* consults to find modules for importing.\\n\\npath entry finder\\n   a *finder* returned by a callable on \"sys.path_hooks\" (i.e. a *path\\n   entry hook*) which knows how to locate modules given a *path\\n   entry*.\\n\\n   see \"importlib.abc.pathentryfinder\" for the methods that path entry\\n   finders implement.\\n\\npath entry hook\\n   a callable on the \"sys.path_hook\" list which returns a *path entry\\n   finder* if it knows how to find modules on a specific *path entry*.\\n\\npath based finder\\n   one of the default *meta path finders* which searches an *import\\n   path* for modules.\\n\\npath-like object\\n   an object representing a file system path. a path-like object is\\n   either a \"str\" or \"bytes\" object representing a path, or an object\\n   implementing the \"os.pathlike\" protocol. an object that supports\\n   the \"os.pathlike\" protocol can be converted to a \"str\" or \"bytes\"\\n   file system path by calling the \"os.fspath()\" function;\\n   \"os.fsdecode()\" and \"os.fsencode()\" can be used to guarantee a\\n   \"str\" or \"bytes\" result instead, respectively. introduced by **pep\\n   519**.\\n\\npep\\n   python enhancement proposal. a pep is a design document providing\\n   information to the python community, or describing a new feature\\n   for python or its processes or environment. peps should provide a\\n   concise technical specification and a rationale for proposed\\n   features.\\n\\n   peps are intended to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major\\n   new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for\\n   documenting the design decisions that have gone into python. the\\n   pep author is responsible for building consensus within the\\n   community and documenting dissenting opinions.\\n\\n   see **pep 1**.\\n\\nportion\\n   a set of files in a single directory (possibly stored in a zip\\n   file) that contribute to a namespace package, as defined in **pep\\n   420**.\\n\\npositional argument\\n   see *argument*.\\n\\nprovisional api\\n   a provisional api is one which has been deliberately excluded from\\n   the standard library\\'s backwards compatibility guarantees.  while\\n   major changes to such interfaces are not expected, as long as they\\n   are marked provisional, backwards incompatible changes (up to and\\n   including removal of the interface) may occur if deemed necessary\\n   by core developers.  such changes will not be made gratuitously --\\n   they will occur only if serious fundamental flaws are uncovered\\n   that were missed prior to the inclusion of the api.\\n\\n   even for provisional apis, backwards incompatible changes are seen\\n   as a \"solution of last resort\" - every attempt will still be made\\n   to find a backwards compatible resolution to any identified\\n   problems.\\n\\n   this process allows the standard library to continue to evolve over\\n   time, without locking in problematic design errors for extended\\n   periods of time.  see **pep 411** for more details.\\n\\nprovisional package\\n   see *provisional api*.\\n\\npython 3000\\n   nickname for the python 3.x release line (coined long ago when the\\n   release of version 3 was something in the distant future.)  this is\\n   also abbreviated \"py3k\".\\n\\npythonic\\n   an idea or piece of code which closely follows the most common\\n   idioms of the python language, rather than implementing code using\\n   concepts common to other languages.  for example, a common idiom in\\n   python is to loop over all elements of an iterable using a \"for\"\\n   statement.  many other languages don\\'t have this type of construct,\\n   so people unfamiliar with python sometimes use a numerical counter\\n   instead:\\n\\n      for i in range(len(food)):\\n          print(food[i])\\n\\n   as opposed to the cleaner, pythonic method:\\n\\n      for piece in food:\\n          print(piece)\\n\\nqualified name\\n   a dotted name showing the \"path\" from a module\\'s global scope to a\\n   class, function or method defined in that module, as defined in\\n   **pep 3155**.  for top-level functions and classes, the qualified\\n   name is the same as the object\\'s name:\\n\\n      >>> class c:\\n      ...     class d:\\n      ...         def meth(self):\\n      ...             pass\\n      ...\\n      >>> c.__qualname__\\n      \\'c\\'\\n      >>> c.d.__qualname__\\n      \\'c.d\\'\\n      >>> c.d.meth.__qualname__\\n      \\'c.d.meth\\'\\n\\n   when used to refer to modules, the *fully qualified name* means the\\n   entire dotted path to the module, including any parent packages,\\n   e.g. \"email.mime.text\":\\n\\n      >>> import email.mime.text\\n      >>> email.mime.text.__name__\\n      \\'email.mime.text\\'\\n\\nreference count\\n   the number of references to an object.  when the reference count of\\n   an object drops to zero, it is deallocated.  reference counting is\\n   generally not visible to python code, but it is a key element of\\n   the *cpython* implementation.  the \"sys\" module defines a\\n   \"getrefcount()\" function that programmers can call to return the\\n   reference count for a particular object.\\n\\nregular package\\n   a traditional *package*, such as a directory containing an\\n   \"__init__.py\" file.\\n\\n   see also *namespace package*.\\n\\n__slots__\\n   a declaration inside a class that saves memory by pre-declaring\\n   space for instance attributes and eliminating instance\\n   dictionaries.  though popular, the technique is somewhat tricky to\\n   get right and is best reserved for rare cases where there are large\\n   numbers of instances in a memory-critical application.\\n\\nsequence\\n   an *iterable* which supports efficient element access using integer\\n   indices via the \"__getitem__()\" special method and defines a\\n   \"__len__()\" method that returns the length of the sequence. some\\n   built-in sequence types are \"list\", \"str\", \"tuple\", and \"bytes\".\\n   note that \"dict\" also supports \"__getitem__()\" and \"__len__()\", but\\n   is considered a mapping rather than a sequence because the lookups\\n   use arbitrary *immutable* keys rather than integers.\\n\\n   the \"collections.abc.sequence\" abstract base class defines a much\\n   richer interface that goes beyond just \"__getitem__()\" and\\n   \"__len__()\", adding \"count()\", \"index()\", \"__contains__()\", and\\n   \"__reversed__()\". types that implement this expanded interface can\\n   be registered explicitly using \"register()\".\\n\\nset comprehension\\n   a compact way to process all or part of the elements in an iterable\\n   and return a set with the results. \"results = {c for c in\\n   \\'abracadabra\\' if c not in \\'abc\\'}\" generates the set of strings\\n   \"{\\'r\\', \\'d\\'}\".  see displays for lists, sets and dictionaries.\\n\\nsingle dispatch\\n   a form of *generic function* dispatch where the implementation is\\n   chosen based on the type of a single argument.\\n\\nslice\\n   an object usually containing a portion of a *sequence*.  a slice is\\n   created using the subscript notation, \"[]\" with colons between\\n   numbers when several are given, such as in \"variable_name[1:3:5]\".\\n   the bracket (subscript) notation uses \"slice\" objects internally.\\n\\nspecial method\\n   a method that is called implicitly by python to execute a certain\\n   operation on a type, such as addition.  such methods have names\\n   starting and ending with double underscores.  special methods are\\n   documented in special method names.\\n\\nstatement\\n   a statement is part of a suite (a \"block\" of code).  a statement is\\n   either an *expression* or one of several constructs with a keyword,\\n   such as \"if\", \"while\" or \"for\".\\n\\nstrong reference\\n   in python\\'s c api, a strong reference is a reference to an object\\n   which increments the object\\'s reference count when it is created\\n   and decrements the object\\'s reference count when it is deleted.\\n\\n   the \"py_newref()\" function can be used to create a strong reference\\n   to an object. usually, the \"py_decref()\" function must be called on\\n   the strong reference before exiting the scope of the strong\\n   reference, to avoid leaking one reference.\\n\\n   see also *borrowed reference*.\\n\\ntext encoding\\n   a codec which encodes unicode strings to bytes.\\n\\ntext file\\n   a *file object* able to read and write \"str\" objects. often, a text\\n   file actually accesses a byte-oriented datastream and handles the\\n   *text encoding* automatically. examples of text files are files\\n   opened in text mode (\"\\'r\\'\" or \"\\'w\\'\"), \"sys.stdin\", \"sys.stdout\",\\n   and instances of \"io.stringio\".\\n\\n   see also *binary file* for a file object able to read and write\\n   *bytes-like objects*.\\n\\ntriple-quoted string\\n   a string which is bound by three instances of either a quotation\\n   mark (\") or an apostrophe (\\').  while they don\\'t provide any\\n   functionality not available with single-quoted strings, they are\\n   useful for a number of reasons.  they allow you to include\\n   unescaped single and double quotes within a string and they can\\n   span multiple lines without the use of the continuation character,\\n   making them especially useful when writing docstrings.\\n\\ntype\\n   the type of a python object determines what kind of object it is;\\n   every object has a type.  an object\\'s type is accessible as its\\n   \"__class__\" attribute or can be retrieved with \"type(obj)\".\\n\\ntype alias\\n   a synonym for a type, created by assigning the type to an\\n   identifier.\\n\\n   type aliases are useful for simplifying *type hints*. for example:\\n\\n      def remove_gray_shades(\\n              colors: list[tuple[int, int, int]]) -> list[tuple[int, int, int]]:\\n          pass\\n\\n   could be made more readable like this:\\n\\n      color = tuple[int,

since version 3.11: the \"xdrlib\" module is deprecated (see\\n**pep 594** for details).\\n\\n======================================================================\\n\\nthe \"xdrlib\" module supports the external data representation standard\\nas described in **rfc 1014**, written by sun microsystems, inc. june\\n1987.  it supports most of the data types described in the rfc.\\n\\nthe \"xdrlib\" module defines two classes, one for packing variables\\ninto xdr representation, and another for unpacking from xdr\\nrepresentation.  there are also two exception classes.\\n\\nclass xdrlib.packer\\n\\n   \"packer\" is the class for packing data into xdr representation. the\\n   \"packer\" class is instantiated with no arguments.\\n\\nclass xdrlib.unpacker(data)\\n\\n   \"unpacker\" is the complementary class which unpacks xdr data values\\n   from a string buffer.  the input buffer is given as *data*.\\n\\nsee also:\\n\\n  **rfc 1014** - xdr: external data representation standard\\n     this rfc defined the encoding of data which was xdr at the time\\n     this module was originally written.  it has apparently been\\n     obsoleted by **rfc 1832**.\\n\\n  **rfc 1832** - xdr: external data representation standard\\n     newer rfc that provides a revised definition of xdr.\\n\\n\\npacker objects\\n==============\\n\\n\"packer\" instances have the following methods:\\n\\npacker.get_buffer()\\n\\n   returns the current pack buffer as a string.\\n\\npacker.reset()\\n\\n   resets the pack buffer to the empty string.\\n\\nin general, you can pack any of the most common xdr data types by\\ncalling the appropriate \"pack_type()\" method.  each method takes a\\nsingle argument, the value to pack.  the following simple data type\\npacking methods are supported: \"pack_uint()\", \"pack_int()\",\\n\"pack_enum()\", \"pack_bool()\", \"pack_uhyper()\", and \"pack_hyper()\".\\n\\npacker.pack_float(value)\\n\\n   packs the single-precision floating point number *value*.\\n\\npacker.pack_double(value)\\n\\n   packs the double-precision floating point number *value*.\\n\\nthe following methods support packing strings, bytes, and opaque data:\\n\\npacker.pack_fstring(n, s)\\n\\n   packs a fixed length string, *s*.  *n* is the length of the string\\n   but it is *not* packed into the data buffer.  the string is padded\\n   with null bytes if necessary to guaranteed 4 byte alignment.\\n\\npacker.pack_fopaque(n, data)\\n\\n   packs a fixed length opaque data stream, similarly to\\n   \"pack_fstring()\".\\n\\npacker.pack_string(s)\\n\\n   packs a variable length string, *s*.  the length of the string is\\n   first packed as an unsigned integer, then the string data is packed\\n   with \"pack_fstring()\".\\n\\npacker.pack_opaque(data)\\n\\n   packs a variable length opaque data string, similarly to\\n   \"pack_string()\".\\n\\npacker.pack_bytes(bytes)\\n\\n   packs a variable length byte stream, similarly to \"pack_string()\".\\n\\nthe following methods support packing arrays and lists:\\n\\npacker.pack_list(list, pack_item)\\n\\n   packs a *list* of homogeneous items.  this method is useful for\\n   lists with an indeterminate size; i.e. the size is not available\\n   until the entire list has been walked.  for each item in the list,\\n   an unsigned integer \"1\" is packed first, followed by the data value\\n   from the list.  *pack_item* is the function that is called to pack\\n   the individual item.  at the end of the list, an unsigned integer\\n   \"0\" is packed.\\n\\n   for example, to pack a list of integers, the code might appear like\\n   this:\\n\\n      import xdrlib\\n      p = xdrlib.packer()\\n      p.pack_list([1, 2, 3], p.pack_int)\\n\\npacker.pack_farray(n, array, pack_item)\\n\\n   packs a fixed length list (*array*) of homogeneous items.  *n* is\\n   the length of the list; it is *not* packed into the buffer, but a\\n   \"valueerror\" exception is raised if \"len(array)\" is not equal to\\n   *n*.  as above, *pack_item* is the function used to pack each\\n   element.\\n\\npacker.pack_array(list, pack_item)\\n\\n   packs a variable length *list* of homogeneous items.  first, the\\n   length of the list is packed as an unsigned integer, then each\\n   element is packed as in \"pack_farray()\" above.\\n\\n\\nunpacker objects\\n================\\n\\nthe \"unpacker\" class offers the following methods:\\n\\nunpacker.reset(data)\\n\\n   resets the string buffer with the given *data*.\\n\\nunpacker.get_position()\\n\\n   returns the current unpack position in the data buffer.\\n\\nunpacker.set_position(position)\\n\\n   sets the data buffer unpack position to *position*.  you should be\\n   careful about using \"get_position()\" and \"set_position()\".\\n\\nunpacker.get_buffer()\\n\\n   returns the current unpack data buffer as a string.\\n\\nunpacker.done()\\n\\n   indicates unpack completion.  raises an \"error\" exception if all of\\n   the data has not been unpacked.\\n\\nin addition, every data type that can be packed with a \"packer\", can\\nbe unpacked with an \"unpacker\".  unpacking methods are of the form\\n\"unpack_type()\", and take no arguments.  they return the unpacked\\nobject.\\n\\nunpacker.unpack_float()\\n\\n   unpacks a single-precision floating point number.\\n\\nunpacker.unpack_double()\\n\\n   unpacks a double-precision floating point number, similarly to\\n   \"unpack_float()\".\\n\\nin addition, the following methods unpack strings, bytes, and opaque\\ndata:\\n\\nunpacker.unpack_fstring(n)\\n\\n   unpacks and returns a fixed length string.  *n* is the number of\\n   characters expected.  padding with null bytes to guaranteed 4 byte\\n   alignment is assumed.\\n\\nunpacker.unpack_fopaque(n)\\n\\n   unpacks and returns a fixed length opaque data stream, similarly to\\n   \"unpack_fstring()\".\\n\\nunpacker.unpack_string()\\n\\n   unpacks and returns a variable length string.  the length of the\\n   string is first unpacked as an unsigned integer, then the string\\n   data is unpacked with \"unpack_fstring()\".\\n\\nunpacker.unpack_opaque()\\n\\n   unpacks and returns a variable length opaque data string, similarly\\n   to \"unpack_string()\".\\n\\nunpacker.unpack_bytes()\\n\\n   unpacks and returns a variable length byte stream, similarly to\\n   \"unpack_string()\".\\n\\nthe following methods support unpacking arrays and lists:\\n\\nunpacker.unpack_list(unpack_item)\\n\\n   unpacks and returns a list of homogeneous items.  the list is\\n   unpacked one element at a time by first unpacking an unsigned\\n   integer flag.  if the flag is \"1\", then the item is unpacked and\\n   appended to the list.  a flag of \"0\" indicates the end of the list.\\n   *unpack_item* is the function that is called to unpack the items.\\n\\nunpacker.unpack_farray(n, unpack_item)\\n\\n   unpacks and returns (as a list) a fixed length array of homogeneous\\n   items.  *n* is number of list elements to expect in the buffer. as\\n   above, *unpack_item* is the function used to unpack each element.\\n\\nunpacker.unpack_array(unpack_item)\\n\\n   unpacks and returns a variable length *list* of homogeneous items.\\n   first, the length of the list is unpacked as an unsigned integer,\\n   then each element is unpacked as in \"unpack_farray()\" above.\\n\\n\\nexceptions\\n==========\\n\\nexceptions in this module are coded as class instances:\\n\\nexception xdrlib.error\\n\\n   the base exception class.  \"error\" has a single public attribute\\n   \"msg\" containing the description of the error.\\n\\nexception xdrlib.conversionerror\\n\\n   class derived from \"error\".  contains no additional instance\\n   variables.\\n\\nhere is an example of how you would catch one of these exceptions:\\n\\n   import xdrlib\\n   p = xdrlib.packer()\\n   try:\\n       p.pack_double(8.01)\\n   except xdrlib.conversionerror as instance:\\n       print(\\'packing the double failed:\\', instance.msg)\\n\"zlib\" --- compression compatible with **gzip**\\n***********************************************\\n\\n======================================================================\\n\\nfor applications that require data compression, the functions in this\\nmodule allow compression and decompression, using the zlib library.\\nthe zlib library has its own home page at https://www.zlib.net.\\nthere are known incompatibilities between the python module and\\nversions of the zlib library earlier than 1.1.3; 1.1.3 has a security\\nvulnerability, so we recommend using 1.1.4 or later.\\n\\nzlib\\'s functions have many options and often need to be used in a\\nparticular order.  this documentation doesn\\'t attempt to cover all of\\nthe permutations; consult the zlib manual at\\nhttp://www.zlib.net/manual.html for authoritative information.\\n\\nfor reading and writing \".gz\" files see the \"gzip\" module.\\n\\nthe available exception and functions in this module are:\\n\\nexception zlib.error\\n\\n   exception raised on compression and decompression errors.\\n\\nzlib.adler32(data[, value])\\n\\n   computes an adler-32 checksum of *data*.  (an adler-32 checksum is\\n   almost as reliable as a crc32 but can be computed much more\\n   quickly.)  the result is an unsigned 32-bit integer.  if *value* is\\n   present, it is used as the starting value of the checksum;\\n   otherwise, a default value of 1 is used.  passing in *value* allows\\n   computing a running checksum over the concatenation of several\\n   inputs.  the algorithm is not cryptographically strong, and should\\n   not be used for authentication or digital signatures.  since the\\n   algorithm is designed for use as a checksum algorithm, it is not\\n   suitable for use as a general hash algorithm.\\n\\n   changed in version 3.0: the result is always unsigned. to generate\\n   the same numeric value when using python 2 or earlier, use\\n   \"adler32(data) & 0xffffffff\".\\n\\nzlib.compress(data, /, level=- 1)\\n\\n   compresses the bytes in *data*, returning a bytes object containing\\n   compressed data. *level* is an integer from \"0\" to \"9\" or \"-1\"\\n   controlling the level of compression; \"1\" (z_best_speed) is fastest\\n   and produces the least compression, \"9\" (z_best_compression) is\\n   slowest and produces the most.  \"0\" (z_no_compression) is no\\n   compression. the default value is \"-1\" (z_default_compression).\\n   z_default_compression represents a default compromise between speed\\n   and compression (currently equivalent to level 6). raises the\\n   \"error\" exception if any error occurs.\\n\\n   changed in version 3.6: *level* can now be used as a keyword\\n   parameter.\\n\\nzlib.compressobj(level=-1, method=deflated, wbits=max_wbits, memlevel=def_mem_level, strategy=z_default_strategy[, zdict])\\n\\n   returns a compression object, to be used for compressing data\\n   streams that won\\'t fit into memory at once.\\n\\n   *level* is the compression level -- an integer from \"0\" to \"9\" or\\n   \"-1\". a value of \"1\" (z_best_speed) is fastest and produces the\\n   least compression, while a value of \"9\" (z_best_compression) is\\n   slowest and produces the most. \"0\" (z_no_compression) is no\\n   compression.  the default value is \"-1\" (z_default_compression).\\n   z_default_compression represents a default compromise between speed\\n   and compression (currently equivalent to level 6).\\n\\n   *method* is the compression algorithm. currently, the only\\n   supported value is \"deflated\".\\n\\n   the *wbits* argument controls the size of the history buffer (or\\n   the \"window size\") used when compressing data, and whether a header\\n   and trailer is included in the output.  it can take several ranges\\n   of values, defaulting to \"15\" (max_wbits):\\n\\n   * +9 to +15: the base-two logarithm of the window size, which\\n     therefore ranges between 512 and 32768.  larger values produce\\n     better compression at the expense of greater memory usage.  the\\n     resulting output will include a zlib-specific header and trailer.\\n\\n   * −9 to −15: uses the absolute value of *wbits* as the window size\\n     logarithm, while producing a raw output stream with no header or\\n     trailing checksum.\\n\\n   * +25 to +31 = 16 + (9 to 15): uses the low 4 bits of the value as\\n     the window size logarithm, while including a basic **gzip**\\n     header and trailing checksum in the output.\\n\\n   the *memlevel* argument controls the amount of memory used for the\\n   internal compression state. valid values range from \"1\" to \"9\".\\n   higher values use more memory, but are faster and produce smaller\\n   output.\\n\\n   *strategy* is used to tune the compression algorithm. possible\\n   values are \"z_default_strategy\", \"z_filtered\", \"z_huffman_only\",\\n   \"z_rle\" (zlib 1.2.0.1) and \"z_fixed\" (zlib 1.2.2.2).\\n\\n   *zdict* is a predefined compression dictionary. this is a sequence\\n   of bytes (such as a \"bytes\" object) containing subsequences that\\n   are expected to occur frequently in the data that is to be\\n   compressed. those subsequences that are expected to be most common\\n   should come at the end of the dictionary.\\n\\n   changed in version 3.3: added the *zdict* parameter and keyword\\n   argument support.\\n\\nzlib.crc32(data[, value])\\n\\n   computes a crc (cyclic redundancy check) checksum of *data*. the\\n   result is an unsigned 32-bit integer. if *value* is present, it is\\n   used as the starting value of the checksum; otherwise, a default\\n   value of 0 is used.  passing in *value* allows computing a running\\n   checksum over the concatenation of several inputs.  the algorithm\\n   is not cryptographically strong, and should not be used for\\n   authentication or digital signatures.  since the algorithm is\\n   designed for use as a checksum algorithm, it is not suitable for\\n   use as a general hash algorithm.\\n\\n   changed in version 3.0: the result is always unsigned. to generate\\n   the same numeric value when using python 2 or earlier, use\\n   \"crc32(data) & 0xffffffff\".\\n\\nzlib.decompress(data, /, wbits=max_wbits, bufsize=def_buf_size)\\n\\n   decompresses the bytes in *data*, returning a bytes object\\n   containing the uncompressed data.  the *wbits* parameter depends on\\n   the format of *data*, and is discussed further below. if *bufsize*\\n   is given, it is used as the initial size of the output buffer.\\n   raises the \"error\" exception if any error occurs.\\n\\n   the *wbits* parameter controls the size of the history buffer (or\\n   \"window size\"), and what header and trailer format is expected. it\\n   is similar to the parameter for \"compressobj()\", but accepts more\\n   ranges of values:\\n\\n   * +8 to +15: the base-two logarithm of the window size.  the input\\n     must include a zlib header and trailer.\\n\\n   * 0: automatically determine the window size from the zlib header.\\n     only supported since zlib 1.2.3.5.\\n\\n   * −8 to −15: uses the absolute value of *wbits* as the window size\\n     logarithm.  the input must be a raw stream with no header or\\n     trailer.\\n\\n   * +24 to +31 = 16 + (8 to 15): uses the low 4 bits of the value as\\n     the window size logarithm.  the input must include a gzip header\\n     and trailer.\\n\\n   * +40 to +47 = 32 + (8 to 15): uses the low 4 bits of the value as\\n     the window size logarithm, and automatically accepts either the\\n     zlib or gzip format.\\n\\n   when decompressing a stream, the window size must not be smaller\\n   than the size originally used to compress the stream; using a too-\\n   small value may result in an \"error\" exception. the default *wbits*\\n   value corresponds to the largest window size and requires a zlib\\n   header and trailer to be included.\\n\\n   *bufsize* is the initial size of the buffer used to hold\\n   decompressed data.  if more space is required, the buffer size will\\n   be increased as needed, so you don\\'t have to get this value exactly\\n   right; tuning it will only save a few calls to \"malloc()\".\\n\\n   changed in version 3.6: *wbits* and *bufsize* can be used as\\n   keyword arguments.\\n\\nzlib.decompressobj(wbits=max_wbits[, zdict])\\n\\n   returns a decompression object, to be used for decompressing data\\n   streams that won\\'t fit into memory at once.\\n\\n   the *wbits* parameter controls the size of the history buffer (or\\n   the \"window size\"), and what header and trailer format is expected.\\n   it has the same meaning as described for decompress().\\n\\n   the *zdict* parameter specifies a predefined compression\\n   dictionary. if provided, this must be the same dictionary as was\\n   used by the compressor that produced the data that is to be\\n   decompressed.\\n\\n   note:\\n\\n     if *zdict* is a mutable object (such as a \"bytearray\"), you must\\n     not modify its contents between the call to \"decompressobj()\" and\\n     the first call to the decompressor\\'s \"decompress()\" method.\\n\\n   changed in version 3.3: added the *zdict* parameter.\\n\\ncompression objects support the following methods:\\n\\ncompress.compress(data)\\n\\n   compress *data*, returning a bytes object containing compressed\\n   data for at least part of the data in *data*.  this data should be\\n   concatenated to the output produced by any preceding calls to the\\n   \"compress()\" method.  some input may be kept in internal buffers\\n   for later processing.\\n\\ncompress.flush([mode])\\n\\n   all pending input is processed, and a bytes object containing the\\n   remaining compressed output is returned.  *mode* can be selected\\n   from the constants \"z_no_flush\", \"z_partial_flush\", \"z_sync_flush\",\\n   \"z_full_flush\", \"z_block\" (zlib 1.2.3.4), or \"z_finish\", defaulting\\n   to \"z_finish\".  except \"z_finish\", all constants allow compressing\\n   further bytestrings of data, while \"z_finish\" finishes the\\n   compressed stream and prevents compressing any more data.  after\\n   calling \"flush()\" with *mode* set to \"z_finish\", the \"compress()\"\\n   method cannot be called again; the only realistic action is to\\n   delete the object.\\n\\ncompress.copy()\\n\\n   returns a copy of the compression object.  this can be used to\\n   efficiently compress a set of data that share a common initial\\n   prefix.\\n\\nchanged in version 3.8: added \"copy.copy()\" and \"copy.deepcopy()\"\\nsupport to compression objects.\\n\\ndecompression objects support the following methods and attributes:\\n\\ndecompress.unused_data\\n\\n   a bytes object which contains any bytes past the end of the\\n   compressed data. that is, this remains \"b\"\"\" until the last byte\\n   that contains compression data is available.  if the whole\\n   bytestring turned out to contain compressed data, this is \"b\"\"\", an\\n   empty bytes object.\\n\\ndecompress.unconsumed_tail\\n\\n   a bytes object that contains any data that was not consumed by the\\n   last \"decompress()\" call because it exceeded the limit for the\\n   uncompressed data buffer.  this data has not yet been seen by the\\n   zlib machinery, so you must feed it (possibly with further data\\n   concatenated to it) back to a subsequent \"decompress()\" method call\\n   in order to get correct output.\\n\\ndecompress.eof\\n\\n   a boolean indicating whether the end of the compressed data stream\\n   has been reached.\\n\\n   this makes it possible to distinguish between a properly-formed\\n   compressed stream, and an incomplete or truncated one.\\n\\n   new in version 3.3.\\n\\ndecompress.decompress(data, max_length=0)\\n\\n   decompress *data*, returning a bytes object containing the\\n   uncompressed data corresponding to at least part of the data in\\n   *string*.  this data should be concatenated to the output produced\\n   by any preceding calls to the \"decompress()\" method.  some of the\\n   input data may be preserved in internal buffers for later\\n   processing.\\n\\n   if the optional parameter *max_length* is non-zero then the return\\n   value will be no longer than *max_length*. this may mean that not\\n   all of the compressed input can be processed; and unconsumed data\\n   will be stored in the attribute \"unconsumed_tail\". this bytestring\\n   must be passed to a subsequent call to \"decompress()\" if\\n   decompression is to continue.  if *max_length* is zero then the\\n   whole input is decompressed, and \"unconsumed_tail\" is empty.\\n\\n   changed in version 3.6: *max_length* can be used as a keyword\\n   argument.\\n\\ndecompress.flush([length])\\n\\n   all pending input is processed, and a bytes object containing the\\n   remaining uncompressed output is returned.  after calling\\n   \"flush()\", the \"decompress()\" method cannot be called again; the\\n   only realistic action is to delete the object.\\n\\n   the optional parameter *length* sets the initial size of the output\\n   buffer.\\n\\ndecompress.copy()\\n\\n   returns a copy of the decompression object.  this can be used to\\n   save the state of the decompressor midway through the data stream\\n   in order to speed up random seeks into the stream at a future\\n   point.\\n\\nchanged in version 3.8: added \"copy.copy()\" and \"copy.deepcopy()\"\\nsupport to decompression objects.\\n\\ninformation about the version of the zlib library in use is available\\nthrough the following constants:\\n\\nzlib.zlib_version\\n\\n   the version string of the zlib library that was used for building\\n   the module. this may be different from the zlib library actually\\n   used at runtime, which is available as \"zlib_runtime_version\".\\n\\nzlib.zlib_runtime_version\\n\\n   the version string of the zlib library actually loaded by the\\n   interpreter.\\n\\n   new in version 3.3.\\n\\nsee also:\\n\\n  module \"gzip\"\\n     reading and writing **gzip**-format files.\\n\\n  http://www.zlib.net\\n     the zlib library home page.\\n\\n  http://www.zlib.net/manual.html\\n     the zlib manual explains  the semantics and usage of the\\n     library\\'s many functions.\\n16. appendix\\n************\\n\\n\\n16.1. interactive mode\\n======================\\n\\n\\n16.1.1. error handling\\n----------------------\\n\\nwhen an error occurs, the interpreter prints an error message and a\\nstack trace. in interactive mode, it then returns to the primary\\nprompt; when input came from a file, it exits with a nonzero exit\\nstatus after printing the stack trace. (exceptions handled by an\\n\"except\" clause in a \"try\" statement are not errors in this context.)\\nsome errors are unconditionally fatal and cause an exit with a nonzero\\nexit; this applies to internal inconsistencies and some cases of\\nrunning out of memory.  all error messages are written to the standard\\nerror stream; normal output from executed commands is written to\\nstandard output.\\n\\ntyping the interrupt character (usually \"control-c\" or \"delete\") to\\nthe primary or secondary prompt cancels the input and returns to the\\nprimary prompt. [1] typing an interrupt while a command is executing\\nraises the \"keyboardinterrupt\" exception, which may be handled by a\\n\"try\" statement.\\n\\n\\n16.1.2. executable python scripts\\n---------------------------------\\n\\non bsd\\'ish unix systems, python scripts can be made directly\\nexecutable, like shell scripts, by putting the line\\n\\n   #!/usr/bin/env python3.5\\n\\n(assuming that the interpreter is on the user\\'s \"path\") at the\\nbeginning of the script and giving the file an executable mode.  the\\n\"#!\" must be the first two characters of the file.  on some platforms,\\nthis first line must end with a unix-style line ending (\"\\'\\\\n\\'\"), not a\\nwindows (\"\\'\\\\r\\\\n\\'\") line ending.  note that the hash, or pound,\\ncharacter, \"\\'#\\'\", is used to start a comment in python.\\n\\nthe script can be given an executable mode, or permission, using the\\n**chmod** command.\\n\\n   $ chmod +x myscript.py\\n\\non windows systems, there is no notion of an \"executable mode\".  the\\npython installer automatically associates \".py\" files with\\n\"python.exe\" so that a double-click on a python file will run it as a\\nscript.  the extension can also be \".pyw\", in that case, the console\\nwindow that normally appears is suppressed.\\n\\n\\n16.1.3. the interactive startup file\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nwhen you use python interactively, it is frequently handy to have some\\nstandard commands executed every time the interpreter is started.  you\\ncan do this by setting an environment variable named \"pythonstartup\"\\nto the name of a file containing your start-up commands.  this is\\nsimilar to the \".profile\" feature of the unix shells.\\n\\nthis file is only read in interactive sessions, not when python reads\\ncommands from a script, and not when \"/dev/tty\" is given as the\\nexplicit source of commands (which otherwise behaves like an\\ninteractive session).  it is executed in the same namespace where\\ninteractive commands are executed, so that objects that it defines or\\nimports can be used without qualification in the interactive session.\\nyou can also change the prompts \"sys.ps1\" and \"sys.ps2\" in this file.\\n\\nif you want to read an additional start-up file from the current\\ndirectory, you can program this in the global start-up file using code\\nlike \"if os.path.isfile(\\'.pythonrc.py\\'):\\nexec(open(\\'.pythonrc.py\\').read())\". if you want to use the startup\\nfile in a script, you must do this explicitly in the script:\\n\\n   import os\\n   filename = os.environ.get(\\'pythonstartup\\')\\n   if filename and os.path.isfile(filename):\\n       with open(filename) as fobj:\\n           startup_file = fobj.read()\\n       exec(startup_file)\\n\\n\\n16.1.4. the customization modules\\n---------------------------------\\n\\npython provides two hooks to let you customize it: \"sitecustomize\" and\\n\"usercustomize\".  to see how it works, you need first to find the\\nlocation of your user site-packages directory.  start python and run\\nthis code:\\n\\n   >>> import site\\n   >>> site.getusersitepackages()\\n   \\'/home/user/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages\\'\\n\\nnow you can create a file named \"usercustomize.py\" in that directory\\nand put anything you want in it.  it will affect every invocation of\\npython, unless it is started with the \"-s\" option to disable the\\nautomatic import.\\n\\n\"sitecustomize\" works in the same way, but is typically created by an\\nadministrator of the computer in the global site-packages directory,\\nand is imported before \"usercustomize\".  see the documentation of the\\n\"site\" module for more details.\\n\\n-[ footnotes ]-\\n\\n[1] a problem with the gnu readline package may prevent this.\\n9. classes\\n**********\\n\\nclasses provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.\\ncreating a new class creates a new *type* of object, allowing new\\n*instances* of that type to be made.  each class instance can have\\nattributes attached to it for maintaining its state.  class instances\\ncan also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.\\n\\ncompared with other programming languages, python\\'s class mechanism\\nadds classes with a minimum of new syntax and semantics.  it is a\\nmixture of the class mechanisms found in c++ and modula-3.  python\\nclasses provide all the standard features of object oriented\\nprogramming: the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base\\nclasses, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or\\nclasses, and a method can call the method of a base class with the\\nsame name.  objects can contain arbitrary amounts and kinds of data.\\nas is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic nature of\\npython: they are created at runtime, and can be modified further after\\ncreation.\\n\\nin c++ terminology, normally class members (including the data\\nmembers) are *public* (except see below private variables), and all\\nmember functions are *virtual*.  as in modula-3, there are no\\nshorthands for referencing the object\\'s members from its methods: the\\nmethod function is declared with an explicit first argument\\nrepresenting the object, which is provided implicitly by the call.  as\\nin smalltalk, classes themselves are objects.  this provides semantics\\nfor importing and renaming.  unlike c++ and modula-3, built-in types\\ncan be used as base classes for extension by the user.  also, like in\\nc++, most built-in operators with special syntax (arithmetic\\noperators, subscripting etc.) can be redefined for class instances.\\n\\n(lacking universally accepted terminology to talk about classes, i\\nwill make occasional use of smalltalk and c++ terms.  i would use\\nmodula-3 terms, since its object-oriented semantics are closer to\\nthose of python than c++, but i expect that few readers have heard of\\nit.)\\n\\n\\n9.1. a word about names and objects\\n===================================\\n\\nobjects have individuality, and multiple names (in multiple scopes)\\ncan be bound to the same object.  this is known as aliasing in other\\nlanguages.  this is usually not appreciated on a first glance at\\npython, and can be safely ignored when dealing with immutable basic\\ntypes (numbers, strings, tuples).  however, aliasing has a possibly\\nsurprising effect on the semantics of python code involving mutable\\nobjects such as lists, dictionaries, and most other types. this is\\nusually used to the benefit of the program, since aliases behave like\\npointers in some respects.  for example, passing an object is cheap\\nsince only a pointer is passed by the implementation; and if a\\nfunction modifies an object passed as an argument, the caller will see\\nthe change --- this eliminates the need for two different argument\\npassing mechanisms as in pascal.\\n\\n\\n9.2. python scopes and namespaces\\n=================================\\n\\nbefore introducing classes, i first have to tell you something about\\npython\\'s scope rules.  class definitions play some neat tricks with\\nnamespaces, and you need to know how scopes and namespaces work to\\nfully understand what\\'s going on. incidentally, knowledge about this\\nsubject is useful for any advanced python programmer.\\n\\nlet\\'s begin with some definitions.\\n\\na *namespace* is a mapping from names to objects.  most namespaces are\\ncurrently implemented as python dictionaries, but that\\'s normally not\\nnoticeable in any way (except for performance), and it may change in\\nthe future.  examples of namespaces are: the set of built-in names\\n(containing functions such as \"abs()\", and built-in exception names);\\nthe global names in a module; and the local names in a function\\ninvocation.  in a sense the set of attributes of an object also form a\\nnamespace.  the important thing to know about namespaces is that there\\nis absolutely no relation between names in different namespaces; for\\ninstance, two different modules may both define a function \"maximize\"\\nwithout confusion --- users of the modules must prefix it with the\\nmodule name.\\n\\nby the way, i use the word *attribute* for any name following a dot\\n--- for example, in the expression \"z.real\", \"real\" is an attribute of\\nthe object \"z\".  strictly speaking, references to names in modules are\\nattribute references: in the expression \"modname.funcname\", \"modname\"\\nis a module object and \"funcname\" is an attribute of it.  in this case\\nthere happens to be a straightforward mapping between the module\\'s\\nattributes and the global names defined in the module: they share the\\nsame namespace!  [1]\\n\\nattributes may be read-only or writable.  in the latter case,\\nassignment to attributes is possible.  module attributes are writable:\\nyou can write \"modname.the_answer = 42\".  writable attributes may also\\nbe deleted with the \"del\" statement.  for example, \"del\\nmodname.the_answer\" will remove the attribute \"the_answer\" from the\\nobject named by \"modname\".\\n\\nnamespaces are created at different moments and have different\\nlifetimes.  the namespace containing the built-in names is created\\nwhen the python interpreter starts up, and is never deleted.  the\\nglobal namespace for a module is created when the module definition is\\nread in; normally, module namespaces also last until the interpreter\\nquits.  the statements executed by the top-level invocation of the\\ninterpreter, either read from a script file or interactively, are\\nconsidered part of a module called \"__main__\", so they have their own\\nglobal namespace.  (the built-in names actually also live in a module;\\nthis is called \"builtins\".)\\n\\nthe local namespace for a function is created when the function is\\ncalled, and deleted when the function returns or raises an exception\\nthat is not handled within the function.  (actually, forgetting would\\nbe a better way to describe what actually happens.)  of course,\\nrecursive invocations each have their own local namespace.\\n\\na *scope* is a textual region of a python program where a namespace is\\ndirectly accessible.  \"directly accessible\" here means that an\\nunqualified reference to a name attempts to find the name in the\\nnamespace.\\n\\nalthough scopes are determined statically, they are used dynamically.\\nat any time during execution, there are 3 or 4 nested scopes whose\\nnamespaces are directly accessible:\\n\\n* the innermost scope, which is searched first, contains the local\\n  names\\n\\n* the scopes of any enclosing functions, which are searched starting\\n  with the nearest enclosing scope, contains non-local, but also non-\\n  global names\\n\\n* the next-to-last scope contains the current module\\'s global names\\n\\n* the outermost scope (searched last) is the namespace containing\\n  built-in names\\n\\nif a name is declared global, then all references and assignments go\\ndirectly to the middle scope containing the module\\'s global names.  to\\nrebind variables found outside of the innermost scope, the \"nonlocal\"\\nstatement can be used; if not declared nonlocal, those variables are\\nread-only (an attempt to write to such a variable will simply create a\\n*new* local variable in the innermost scope, leaving the identically\\nnamed outer variable unchanged).\\n\\nusually, the local scope references the local names of the (textually)\\ncurrent function.  outside functions, the local scope references the\\nsame namespace as the global scope: the module\\'s namespace. class\\ndefinitions place yet another namespace in the local scope.\\n\\nit is important to realize that scopes are determined textually: the\\nglobal scope of a function defined in a module is that module\\'s\\nnamespace, no matter from where or by what alias the function is\\ncalled.  on the other hand, the actual search for names is done\\ndynamically, at run time --- however, the language definition is\\nevolving towards static name resolution, at \"compile\" time, so don\\'t\\nrely on dynamic name resolution!  (in fact, local variables are\\nalready determined statically.)\\n\\na special quirk of python is that -- if no \"global\" or \"nonlocal\"\\nstatement is in effect -- assignments to names always go into the\\ninnermost scope. assignments do not copy data --- they just bind names\\nto objects.  the same is true for deletions: the statement \"del x\"\\nremoves the binding of \"x\" from the namespace referenced by the local\\nscope.  in fact, all operations that introduce new names use the local\\nscope: in particular, \"import\" statements and function definitions\\nbind the module or function name in the local scope.\\n\\nthe \"global\" statement can be used to indicate that particular\\nvariables live in the global scope and should be rebound there; the\\n\"nonlocal\" statement indicates that particular variables live in an\\nenclosing scope and should be rebound there.\\n\\n\\n9.2.1. scopes and namespaces example\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nthis is an example demonstrating how to reference the different scopes\\nand namespaces, and how \"global\" and \"nonlocal\" affect variable\\nbinding:\\n\\n   def scope_test():\\n       def do_local():\\n           spam = \"local spam\"\\n\\n       def do_nonlocal():\\n           nonlocal spam\\n           spam = \"nonlocal spam\"\\n\\n       def do_global():\\n           global spam\\n           spam = \"global spam\"\\n\\n       spam = \"test spam\"\\n       do_local()\\n       print(\"after local assignment:\", spam)\\n       do_nonlocal()\\n       print(\"after nonlocal assignment:\", spam)\\n       do_global()\\n       print(\"after global assignment:\", spam)\\n\\n   scope_test()\\n   print(\"in global scope:\", spam)\\n\\nthe output of the example code is:\\n\\n   after local assignment: test spam\\n   after nonlocal assignment: nonlocal spam\\n   after global assignment: nonlocal spam\\n   in global scope: global spam\\n\\nnote how the *local* assignment (which is default) didn\\'t change\\n*scope_test*\\'s binding of *spam*.  the \"nonlocal\" assignment changed\\n*scope_test*\\'s binding of *spam*, and the \"global\" assignment changed\\nthe module-level binding.\\n\\nyou can also see that there was no previous binding for *spam* before\\nthe \"global\" assignment.\\n\\n\\n9.3. a first look at classes\\n============================\\n\\nclasses introduce a little bit of new syntax, three new object types,\\nand some new semantics.\\n\\n\\n9.3.1. class definition syntax\\n------------------------------\\n\\nthe simplest form of class definition looks like this:\\n\\n   class classname:\\n       <statement-1>\\n       .\\n       .\\n       .\\n       <statement-n>\\n\\nclass definitions, like function definitions (\"def\" statements) must\\nbe executed before they have any effect.  (you could conceivably place\\na class definition in a branch of an \"if\" statement, or inside a\\nfunction.)\\n\\nin practice, the statements inside a class definition will usually be\\nfunction definitions, but other statements are allowed, and sometimes\\nuseful --- we\\'ll come back to this later.  the function definitions\\ninside a class normally have a peculiar form of argument list,\\ndictated by the calling conventions for methods --- again, this is\\nexplained later.\\n\\nwhen a class definition is entered, a new namespace is created, and\\nused as the local scope --- thus, all assignments to local variables\\ngo into this new namespace.  in particular, function definitions bind\\nthe name of the new function here.\\n\\nwhen a class definition is left normally (via the end), a *class\\nobject* is created.  this is basically a wrapper around the contents\\nof the namespace created by the class definition; we\\'ll learn more\\nabout class objects in the next section.  the original local scope\\n(the one in effect just before the class definition was entered) is\\nreinstated, and the class object is bound here to the class name given\\nin the class definition header (\"classname\" in the example).\\n\\n\\n9.3.2. class objects\\n--------------------\\n\\nclass objects support two kinds of operations: attribute references\\nand instantiation.\\n\\n*attribute references* use the standard syntax used for all attribute\\nreferences in python: \"obj.name\".  valid attribute names are all the\\nnames that were in the class\\'s namespace when the class object was\\ncreated.  so, if the class definition looked like this:\\n\\n   class myclass:\\n       \"\"\"a simple example class\"\"\"\\n       i = 12345\\n\\n       def f(self):\\n           return \\'hello world\\'\\n\\nthen \"myclass.i\" and \"myclass.f\" are valid attribute references,\\nreturning an integer and a function object, respectively. class\\nattributes can also be assigned to, so you can change the value of\\n\"myclass.i\" by assignment. \"__doc__\" is also a valid attribute,\\nreturning the docstring belonging to the class: \"\"a simple example\\nclass\"\".\\n\\nclass *instantiation* uses function notation.  just pretend that the\\nclass object is a parameterless function that returns a new instance\\nof the class. for example (assuming the above class):\\n\\n   x = myclass()\\n\\ncreates a new *instance* of the class and assigns this object to the\\nlocal variable \"x\".\\n\\nthe instantiation operation (\"calling\" a class object) creates an\\nempty object. many classes like to create objects with instances\\ncustomized to a specific initial state. therefore a class may define a\\nspecial method named \"__init__()\", like this:\\n\\n   def __init__(self):\\n       self.data = []\\n\\nwhen a class defines an \"__init__()\" method, class instantiation\\nautomatically invokes \"__init__()\" for the newly-created class\\ninstance.  so in this example, a new, initialized instance can be\\nobtained by:\\n\\n   x = myclass()\\n\\nof course, the \"__init__()\" method may have arguments for greater\\nflexibility.  in that case, arguments given to the class instantiation\\noperator are passed on to \"__init__()\".  for example,\\n\\n   >>> class complex:\\n   ...     def __init__(self, realpart, imagpart):\\n   ...         self.r = realpart\\n   ...         self.i = imagpart\\n   ...\\n   >>> x = complex(3.0, -4.5)\\n   >>> x.r, x.i\\n   (3.0, -4.5)\\n\\n\\n9.3.3. instance objects\\n-----------------------\\n\\nnow what can we do with instance objects?  the only operations\\nunderstood by instance objects are attribute references.  there are\\ntwo kinds of valid attribute names: data attributes and methods.\\n\\n*data attributes* correspond to \"instance variables\" in smalltalk, and\\nto \"data members\" in c++.  data attributes need not be declared; like\\nlocal variables, they spring into existence when they are first\\nassigned to.  for example, if \"x\" is the instance of \"myclass\" created\\nabove, the following piece of code will print the value \"16\", without\\nleaving a trace:\\n\\n   x.counter = 1\\n   while x.counter < 10:\\n       x.counter = x.counter * 2\\n   print(x.counter)\\n   del x.counter\\n\\nthe other kind of instance attribute reference is a *method*. a method\\nis a function that \"belongs to\" an object.  (in python, the term\\nmethod is not unique to class instances: other object types can have\\nmethods as well.  for example, list objects have methods called\\nappend, insert, remove, sort, and so on. however, in the following\\ndiscussion, we\\'ll use the term method exclusively to mean methods of\\nclass instance objects, unless explicitly stated otherwise.)\\n\\nvalid method names of an instance object depend on its class.  by\\ndefinition, all attributes of a class that are function  objects\\ndefine corresponding methods of its instances.  so in our example,\\n\"x.f\" is a valid method reference, since \"myclass.f\" is a function,\\nbut \"x.i\" is not, since \"myclass.i\" is not.  but \"x.f\" is not the same\\nthing as \"myclass.f\" --- it is a *method object*, not a function\\nobject.\\n\\n\\n9.3.4. method objects\\n---------------------\\n\\nusually, a method is called right after it is bound:\\n\\n   x.f()\\n\\nin the \"myclass\" example, this will return the string \"\\'hello world\\'\".\\nhowever, it is not necessary to call a method right away: \"x.f\" is a\\nmethod object, and can be stored away and called at a later time.  for\\nexample:\\n\\n   xf = x.f\\n   while true:\\n       print(xf())\\n\\nwill continue to print \"hello world\" until the end of time.\\n\\nwhat exactly happens when a method is called?  you may have noticed\\nthat \"x.f()\" was called without an argument above, even though the\\nfunction definition for \"f()\" specified an argument.  what happened to\\nthe argument? surely python raises an exception when a function that\\nrequires an argument is called without any --- even if the argument\\nisn\\'t actually used...\\n\\nactually, you may have guessed the answer: the special thing about\\nmethods is that the instance object is passed as the first argument of\\nthe function.  in our example, the call \"x.f()\" is exactly equivalent\\nto \"myclass.f(x)\".  in general, calling a method with a list of *n*\\narguments is equivalent to calling the corresponding function with an\\nargument list that is created by inserting the method\\'s instance\\nobject before the first argument.\\n\\nif you still don\\'t understand how methods work, a look at the\\nimplementation can perhaps clarify matters.  when a non-data attribute\\nof an instance is referenced, the instance\\'s class is searched.  if\\nthe name denotes a valid class attribute that is a function object, a\\nmethod object is created by packing (pointers to) the instance object\\nand the function object just found together in an abstract object:\\nthis is the method object.  when the method object is called with an\\nargument list, a new argument list is constructed from the instance\\nobject and the argument list, and the function object is called with\\nthis new argument list.\\n\\n\\n9.3.5. class and instance variables\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\ngenerally speaking, instance variables are for data unique to each\\ninstance and class variables are for attributes and methods shared by\\nall instances of the class:\\n\\n   class dog:\\n\\n       kind = \\'canine\\'         # class variable shared by all instances\\n\\n       def __init__(self, name):\\n           self.name = name    # instance variable unique to each instance\\n\\n   >>> d = dog(\\'fido\\')\\n   >>> e = dog(\\'buddy\\')\\n   >>> d.kind                  # shared by all dogs\\n   \\'canine\\'\\n   >>> e.kind                  # shared by all dogs\\n   \\'canine\\'\\n   >>> d.name                  # unique to d\\n   \\'fido\\'\\n   >>> e.name                  # unique to e\\n   \\'buddy\\'\\n\\nas discussed in a word about names and objects, shared data can have\\npossibly surprising effects with involving *mutable* objects such as\\nlists and dictionaries. for example, the *tricks* list in the\\nfollowing code should not be used as a class variable because just a\\nsingle list would be shared by all *dog* instances:\\n\\n   class dog:\\n\\n       tricks = []             # mistaken use of a class variable\\n\\n       def __init__(self, name):\\n           self.name = name\\n\\n       def add_trick(self, trick):\\n           self.tricks.append(trick)\\n\\n   >>> d = dog(\\'fido\\')\\n   >>> e = dog(\\'buddy\\')\\n   >>> d.add_trick(\\'roll over\\')\\n   >>> e.add_trick(\\'play dead\\')\\n   >>> d.tricks                # unexpectedly shared by all dogs\\n   [\\'roll over\\', \\'play dead\\']\\n\\ncorrect design of the class should use an instance variable instead:\\n\\n   class dog:\\n\\n       def __init__(self, name):\\n           self.name = name\\n           self.tricks = []    # creates a new empty list for each dog\\n\\n       def add_trick(self, trick):\\n           self.tricks.append(trick)\\n\\n   >>> d = dog(\\'fido\\')\\n   >>> e = dog(\\'buddy\\')\\n   >>> d.add_trick(\\'roll over\\')\\n   >>> e.add_trick(\\'play dead\\')\\n   >>> d.tricks\\n   [\\'roll over\\']\\n   >>> e.tricks\\n   [\\'play dead\\']\\n\\n\\n9.4. random remarks\\n===================\\n\\nif the same attribute name occurs in both an instance and in a class,\\nthen attribute lookup prioritizes the instance:\\n\\n   >>> class warehouse:\\n           purpose = \\'storage\\'\\n           region = \\'west\\'\\n\\n   >>> w1 = warehouse()\\n   >>> print(w1.purpose, w1.region)\\n   storage west\\n   >>> w2 = warehouse()\\n   >>> w2.region = \\'east\\'\\n   >>> print(w2.purpose, w2.region)\\n   storage east\\n\\ndata attributes may be referenced by methods as well as by ordinary\\nusers (\"clients\") of an object.  in other words, classes are not\\nusable to implement pure abstract data types.  in fact, nothing in\\npython makes it possible to enforce data hiding --- it is all based\\nupon convention.  (on the other hand, the python implementation,\\nwritten in c, can completely hide implementation details and control\\naccess to an object if necessary; this can be used by extensions to\\npython written in c.)\\n\\nclients should use data attributes with care --- clients may mess up\\ninvariants maintained by the methods by stamping on their data\\nattributes.  note that clients may add data attributes of their own to\\nan instance object without affecting the validity of the methods, as\\nlong as name conflicts are avoided --- again, a naming convention can\\nsave a lot of headaches here.\\n\\nthere is no shorthand for referencing data attributes (or other\\nmethods!) from within methods.  i find that this actually increases\\nthe readability of methods: there is no chance of confusing local\\nvariables and instance variables when glancing through a method.\\n\\noften, the first argument of a method is called \"self\".  this is\\nnothing more than a convention: the name \"self\" has absolutely no\\nspecial meaning to python.  note, however, that by not following the\\nconvention your code may be less readable to other python programmers,\\nand it is also conceivable that a *class browser* program might be\\nwritten that relies upon such a convention.\\n\\nany function object that is a class attribute defines a method for\\ninstances of that class.  it is not necessary that the function\\ndefinition is textually enclosed in the class definition: assigning a\\nfunction object to a local variable in the class is also ok.  for\\nexample:\\n\\n   # function defined outside the class\\n   def f1(self, x, y):\\n       return min(x, x+y)\\n\\n   class c:\\n       f = f1\\n\\n       def g(self):\\n           return \\'hello world\\'\\n\\n       h = g\\n\\nnow \"f\", \"g\" and \"h\" are all attributes of class \"c\" that refer to\\nfunction objects, and consequently they are all methods of instances\\nof \"c\" --- \"h\" being exactly equivalent to \"g\".  note that this\\npractice usually only serves to confuse the reader of a program.\\n\\nmethods may call other methods by using method attributes of the\\n\"self\" argument:\\n\\n   class bag:\\n       def __init__(self):\\n           self.data = []\\n\\n       def add(self, x):\\n           self.data.append(x)\\n\\n       def addtwice(self, x):\\n           self.add(x)\\n           self.add(x)\\n\\nmethods may reference global names in the same way as ordinary\\nfunctions.  the global scope associated with a method is the module\\ncontaining its definition.  (a class is never used as a global scope.)\\nwhile one rarely encounters a good reason for using global data in a\\nmethod, there are many legitimate uses of the global scope: for one\\nthing, functions and modules imported into the global scope can be\\nused by methods, as well as functions and classes defined in it.\\nusually, the class containing the method is itself defined in this\\nglobal scope, and in the next section we\\'ll find some good reasons why\\na method would want to reference its own class.\\n\\neach value is an object, and therefore has a *class* (also called its\\n*type*). it is stored as \"object.__class__\".\\n\\n\\n9.5. inheritance\\n================\\n\\nof course, a language feature would not be worthy of the name \"class\"\\nwithout supporting inheritance.  the syntax for a derived class\\ndefinition looks like this:\\n\\n   class derivedclassname(baseclassname):\\n       <statement-1>\\n       .\\n       .\\n       .\\n       <statement-n>\\n\\nthe name \"baseclassname\" must be defined in a scope containing the\\nderived class definition.  in place of a base class name, other\\narbitrary expressions are also allowed.  this can be useful, for\\nexample, when the base class is defined in another module:\\n\\n   class derivedclassname(modname.baseclassname):\\n\\nexecution of a derived class definition proceeds the same as for a\\nbase class. when the class object is constructed, the base class is\\nremembered.  this is used for resolving attribute references: if a\\nrequested attribute is not found in the class, the search proceeds to\\nlook in the base class.  this rule is applied recursively if the base\\nclass itself is derived from some other class.\\n\\nthere\\'s nothing special about instantiation of derived classes:\\n\"derivedclassname()\" creates a new instance of the class.  method\\nreferences are resolved as follows: the corresponding class attribute\\nis searched, descending down the chain of base classes if necessary,\\nand the method reference is valid if this yields a function object.\\n\\nderived classes may override methods of their base classes.  because\\nmethods have no special privileges when calling other methods of the\\nsame object, a method of a base class that calls another method\\ndefined in the same base class may end up calling a method of a\\nderived class that overrides it.  (for c++ programmers: all methods in\\npython are effectively \"virtual\".)\\n\\nan overriding method in a derived class may in fact want to extend\\nrather than simply replace the base class method of the same name.\\nthere is a simple way to call the base class method directly: just\\ncall \"baseclassname.methodname(self, arguments)\".  this is\\noccasionally useful to clients as well.  (note that this only works if\\nthe base class is accessible as \"baseclassname\" in the global scope.)\\n\\npython has two built-in functions that work with inheritance:\\n\\n* use \"isinstance()\" to check an instance\\'s type: \"isinstance(obj,\\n  int)\" will be \"true\" only if \"obj.__class__\" is \"int\" or some class\\n  derived from \"int\".\\n\\n* use \"issubclass()\" to check class inheritance: \"issubclass(bool,\\n  int)\" is \"true\" since \"bool\" is a subclass of \"int\".  however,\\n  \"issubclass(float, int)\" is \"false\" since \"float\" is not a subclass\\n  of \"int\".\\n\\n\\n9.5.1. multiple inheritance\\n---------------------------\\n\\npython supports a form of multiple inheritance as well.  a class\\ndefinition with multiple base classes looks like this:\\n\\n   class derivedclassname(base1, base2, base3):\\n       <statement-1>\\n       .\\n       .\\n       .\\n       <statement-n>\\n\\nfor most purposes, in the simplest cases, you can think of the search\\nfor attributes inherited from a parent class as depth-first, left-to-\\nright, not searching twice in the same class where there is an overlap\\nin the hierarchy. thus, if an attribute is not found in\\n\"derivedclassname\", it is searched for in \"base1\", then (recursively)\\nin the base classes of \"base1\", and if it was not found there, it was\\nsearched for in \"base2\", and so on.\\n\\nin fact, it is slightly more complex than that; the method resolution\\norder changes dynamically to support cooperative calls to \"super()\".\\nthis approach is known in some other multiple-inheritance languages as\\ncall-next-method and is more powerful than the super call found in\\nsingle-inheritance languages.\\n\\ndynamic ordering is necessary because all cases of multiple\\ninheritance exhibit one or more diamond relationships (where at least\\none of the parent classes can be accessed through multiple paths from\\nthe bottommost class).  for example, all classes inherit from\\n\"object\", so any case of multiple inheritance provides more than one\\npath to reach \"object\".  to keep the base classes from being accessed\\nmore than once, the dynamic algorithm linearizes the search order in a\\nway that preserves the left-to-right ordering specified in each class,\\nthat calls each parent only once, and that is monotonic (meaning that\\na class can be subclassed without affecting the precedence order of\\nits parents). taken together, these properties make it possible to\\ndesign reliable and extensible classes with multiple inheritance.  for\\nmore detail, see https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/.\\n\\n\\n9.6. private variables\\n======================\\n\\n\"private\" instance variables that cannot be accessed except from\\ninside an object don\\'t exist in python.  however, there is a\\nconvention that is followed by most python code: a name prefixed with\\nan underscore (e.g. \"_spam\") should be treated as a non-public part of\\nthe api (whether it is a function, a method or a data member).  it\\nshould be considered an implementation detail and subject to change\\nwithout notice.\\n\\nsince there is a valid use-case for class-private members (namely to\\navoid name clashes of names with names defined by subclasses), there\\nis limited support for such a mechanism, called *name mangling*.  any\\nidentifier of the form \"__spam\" (at least two leading underscores, at\\nmost one trailing underscore) is textually replaced with\\n\"_classname__spam\", where \"classname\" is the current class name with\\nleading underscore(s) stripped.  this mangling is done without regard\\nto the syntactic position of the identifier, as long as it occurs\\nwithin the definition of a class.\\n\\nname mangling is helpful for letting subclasses override methods\\nwithout breaking intraclass method calls.  for example:\\n\\n   class mapping:\\n       def __init__(self, iterable):\\n           self.items_list = []\\n           self.__update(iterable)\\n\\n       def update(self, iterable):\\n           for item in iterable:\\n               self.items_list.append(item)\\n\\n       __update = update   # private copy of original update() method\\n\\n   class mappingsubclass(mapping):\\n\\n       def update(self, keys, values):\\n           # provides new signature for update()\\n           # but does not break __init__()\\n           for item in zip(keys, values):\\n               self.items_list.append(item)\\n\\nthe above example would work even if \"mappingsubclass\" were to\\nintroduce a \"__update\" identifier since it is replaced with\\n\"_mapping__update\" in the \"mapping\" class  and\\n\"_mappingsubclass__update\" in the \"mappingsubclass\" class\\nrespectively.\\n\\nnote that the mangling rules are designed mostly to avoid accidents;\\nit still is possible to access or modify a variable that is considered\\nprivate.  this can even be useful in special circumstances, such as in\\nthe debugger.\\n\\nnotice that code passed to \"exec()\" or \"eval()\" does not consider the\\nclassname of the invoking class to be the current class; this is\\nsimilar to the effect of the \"global\" statement, the effect of which\\nis likewise restricted to code that is byte-compiled together.  the\\nsame restriction applies to \"getattr()\", \"setattr()\" and \"delattr()\",\\nas well as when referencing \"__dict__\" directly.\\n\\n\\n9.7. odds and ends\\n==================\\n\\nsometimes it is useful to have a data type similar to the pascal\\n\"record\" or c \"struct\", bundling together a few named data items.  an\\nempty class definition will do nicely:\\n\\n   class employee:\\n       pass\\n\\n   john = employee()  # create an empty employee record\\n\\n   # fill the fields of the record\\n   john.name = \\'john doe\\'\\n   john.dept = \\'computer lab\\'\\n   john.salary = 1000\\n\\na piece of python code that expects a particular abstract data type\\ncan often be passed a class that emulates the methods of that data\\ntype instead.  for instance, if you have a function that formats some\\ndata from a file object, you can define a class with methods \"read()\"\\nand \"readline()\" that get the data from a string buffer instead, and\\npass it as an argument.\\n\\ninstance method objects have attributes, too: \"m.__self__\" is the\\ninstance object with the method \"m()\", and \"m.__func__\" is the\\nfunction object corresponding to the method.\\n\\n\\n9.8. iterators\\n==============\\n\\nby now you have probably noticed that most container objects can be\\nlooped over using a \"for\" statement:\\n\\n   for element in [1, 2, 3]:\\n       print(element)\\n   for element in (1, 2, 3):\\n       print(element)\\n   for key in {\\'one\\':1, \\'two\\':2}:\\n       print(key)\\n   for char in \"123\":\\n       print(char)\\n   for line in open(\"myfile.txt\"):\\n       print(line, end=\\'\\')\\n\\nthis style of access is clear, concise, and convenient.  the use of\\niterators pervades and unifies python.  behind the scenes, the \"for\"\\nstatement calls \"iter()\" on the container object.  the function\\nreturns an iterator object that defines the method \"__next__()\" which\\naccesses elements in the container one at a time.  when there are no\\nmore elements, \"__next__()\" raises a \"stopiteration\" exception which\\ntells the \"for\" loop to terminate.  you can call the \"__next__()\"\\nmethod using the \"next()\" built-in function; this example shows how it\\nall works:\\n\\n   >>> s = \\'abc\\'\\n   >>> it = iter(s)\\n   >>> it\\n   <str_iterator object at 0x10c90e650>\\n   >>> next(it)\\n   \\'a\\'\\n   >>> next(it)\\n   \\'b\\'\\n   >>> next(it)\\n   \\'c\\'\\n   >>> next(it)\\n   traceback (most recent call last):\\n     file \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\n       next(it)\\n   stopiteration\\n\\nhaving seen the mechanics behind the iterator protocol, it is easy to\\nadd iterator behavior to your classes.  define an \"__iter__()\" method\\nwhich returns an object with a \"__next__()\" method.  if the class\\ndefines \"__next__()\", then \"__iter__()\" can just return \"self\":\\n\\n   class reverse:\\n       \"\"\"iterator for looping over a sequence backwards.\"\"\"\\n       def __init__(self, data):\\n           self.data = data\\n           self.index = len(data)\\n\\n       def __iter__(self):\\n           return self\\n\\n       def __next__(self):\\n           if self.index == 0:\\n               raise stopiteration\\n           self.index = self.index - 1\\n           return self.data[self.index]\\n\\n   >>> rev = reverse(\\'spam\\')\\n   >>> iter(rev)\\n   <__main__.reverse object at 0x00a1db50>\\n   >>> for char in rev:\\n   ...     print(char)\\n   ...\\n   m\\n   a\\n   p\\n   s\\n\\n\\n9.9. generators\\n===============\\n\\n*generators* are a simple and powerful tool for creating iterators.\\nthey are written like regular functions but use the \"yield\" statement\\nwhenever they want to return data.  each time \"next()\" is called on\\nit, the generator resumes where it left off (it remembers all the data\\nvalues and which statement was last executed).  an example shows that\\ngenerators can be trivially easy to create:\\n\\n   def reverse(data):\\n       for index in range(len(data)-1, -1, -1):\\n           yield data[index]\\n\\n   >>> for char in reverse(\\'golf\\'):\\n   ...     print(char)\\n   ...\\n   f\\n   l\\n   o\\n   g\\n\\nanything that can be done with generators can also be done with class-\\nbased iterators as described in the previous section.  what makes\\ngenerators so compact is that the \"__iter__()\" and \"__next__()\"\\nmethods are created automatically.\\n\\nanother key feature is that the local variables and execution state\\nare automatically saved between calls.  this made the function easier\\nto write and much more clear than an approach using instance variables\\nlike \"self.index\" and \"self.data\".\\n\\nin addition to automatic method creation and saving program state,\\nwhen generators terminate, they automatically raise \"stopiteration\".\\nin combination, these features make it easy to create iterators with\\nno more effort than writing a regular function.\\n\\n\\n9.10. generator expressions\\n===========================\\n\\nsome simple generators can be coded succinctly as expressions using a\\nsyntax similar to list comprehensions but with parentheses instead of\\nsquare brackets. these expressions are designed for situations where\\nthe generator is used right away by an enclosing function.  generator\\nexpressions are more compact but less versatile than full generator\\ndefinitions and tend to be more memory friendly than equivalent list\\ncomprehensions.\\n\\nexamples:\\n\\n   >>> sum(i*i for i in range(10))                 # sum of squares\\n   285\\n\\n   >>> xvec = [10, 20, 30]\\n   >>> yvec = [7, 5, 3]\\n   >>> sum(x*y for x,y in zip(xvec, yvec))         # dot product\\n   260\\n\\n   >>> unique_words = set(word for line in page  for word in line.split())\\n\\n   >>> valedictorian = max((student.gpa, student.name) for student in graduates)\\n\\n   >>> data = \\'golf\\'\\n   >>> list(data[i] for i in range(len(data)-1, -1, -1))\\n   [\\'f\\', \\'l\\', \\'o\\', \\'g\\']\\n\\n-[ footnotes ]-\\n\\n[1] except for one thing.  module objects have a secret read-only\\n    attribute called \"__dict__\" which returns the dictionary used to\\n    implement the module\\'s namespace; the name \"__dict__\" is an\\n    attribute but not a global name. obviously, using this violates\\n    the abstraction of namespace implementation, and should be\\n    restricted to things like post-mortem debuggers.\\n5. data structures\\n******************\\n\\nthis chapter describes some things you\\'ve learned about already in\\nmore detail, and adds some new things as well.\\n\\n\\n5.1. more on lists\\n==================\\n\\nthe list data type has some more methods.  here are all of the methods\\nof list objects:\\n\\nlist.append(x)\\n\\n   add an item to the end of the list.  equivalent to \"a[len(a):] =\\n   [x]\".\\n\\nlist.extend(iterable)\\n\\n   extend the list by appending all the items from the iterable.\\n   equivalent to \"a[len(a):] = iterable\".\\n\\nlist.insert(i, x)\\n\\n   insert an item at a given position.  the first argument is the\\n   index of the element before which to insert, so \"a.insert(0, x)\"\\n   inserts at the front of the list, and \"a.insert(len(a), x)\" is\\n   equivalent to \"a.append(x)\".\\n\\nlist.remove(x)\\n\\n   remove the first item from the list whose value is equal to *x*.\\n   it raises a \"valueerror\" if there is no such item.\\n\\nlist.pop([i])\\n\\n   remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it.\\n   if no index is specified, \"a.pop()\" removes and returns the last\\n   item in the list.  (the square brackets around the *i* in the\\n   method signature denote that the parameter is optional, not that\\n   you should type square brackets at that position.  you will see\\n   this notation frequently in the python library reference.)\\n\\nlist.clear()\\n\\n   remove all items from the list.  equivalent to \"del a[:]\".\\n\\nlist.index(x[, start[, end]])\\n\\n   return zero-based index in the list of the first item whose value\\n   is equal to *x*. raises a \"valueerror\" if there is no such item.\\n\\n   the optional arguments *start* and *end* are interpreted as in the\\n   slice notation and are used to limit the search to a particular\\n   subsequence of the list.  the returned index is computed relative\\n   to the beginning of the full sequence rather than the *start*\\n   argument.\\n\\nlist.count(x)\\n\\n   return the number of times *x* appears in the list.\\n\\nlist.sort(*, key=none, reverse=false)\\n\\n   sort the items of the list in place (the arguments can be used for\\n   sort customization, see \"sorted()\" for their explanation).\\n\\nlist.reverse()\\n\\n   reverse the elements of the list in place.\\n\\nlist.copy()\\n\\n   return a shallow copy of the list.  equivalent to \"a[:]\".\\n\\nan example that uses most of the list methods:\\n\\n   >>> fruits = [\\'orange\\', \\'apple\\', \\'pear\\', \\'banana\\', \\'kiwi\\', \\'apple\\', \\'banana\\']\\n   >>> fruits.count(\\'apple\\')\\n   2\\n   >>> fruits.count(\\'tangerine\\')\\n   0\\n   >>> fruits.index(\\'banana\\')\\n   3\\n   >>> fruits.index(\\'banana\\', 4)  # find next banana starting a position 4\\n   6\\n   >>> fruits.reverse()\\n   >>> fruits\\n   [\\'banana\\', \\'apple\\', \\'kiwi\\', \\'banana\\', \\'pear\\', \\'apple\\', \\'orange\\']\\n   >>> fruits.append(\\'grape\\')\\n   >>> fruits\\n   [\\'banana\\', \\'apple\\', \\'kiwi\\', \\'banana\\', \\'pear\\', \\'apple\\', \\'orange\\', \\'grape\\']\\n   >>> fruits.sort()\\n   >>> fruits\\n   [\\'apple\\', \\'apple\\', \\'banana\\', \\'banana\\', \\'grape\\', \\'kiwi\\', \\'orange\\', \\'pear\\']\\n   >>> fruits.pop()\\n   \\'pear\\'\\n\\nyou might have noticed that methods like \"insert\", \"remove\" or \"sort\"\\nthat only modify the list have no return value printed -- they return\\nthe default \"none\". [1]  this is a design principle for all mutable\\ndata structures in python.\\n\\nanother thing you might notice is that not all data can be sorted or\\ncompared.  for instance, \"[none, \\'hello\\', 10]\" doesn\\'t sort because\\nintegers can\\'t be compared to strings and *none* can\\'t be compared to\\nother types.  also, there are some types that don\\'t have a defined\\nordering relation.  for example, \"3+4j < 5+7j\" isn\\'t a valid\\ncomparison.\\n\\n\\n5.1.1. using lists as stacks\\n----------------------------\\n\\nthe list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack, where the\\nlast element added is the first element retrieved (\"last-in, first-\\nout\").  to add an item to the top of the stack, use \"append()\".  to\\nretrieve an item from the top of the stack, use \"pop()\" without an\\nexplicit index.  for example:\\n\\n   >>> stack = [3, 4, 5]\\n   >>> stack.append(6)\\n   >>> stack.append(7)\\n   >>> stack\\n   [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\\n   >>> stack.pop()\\n   7\\n   >>> stack\\n   [3, 4, 5, 6]\\n   >>> stack.pop()\\n   6\\n   >>> stack.pop()\\n   5\\n   >>> stack\\n   [3, 4]\\n\\n\\n5.1.2. using lists as queues\\n----------------------------\\n\\nit is also possible to use a list as a queue, where the first element\\nadded is the first element retrieved (\"first-in, first-out\"); however,\\nlists are not efficient for this purpose.  while appends and pops from\\nthe end of list are fast, doing inserts or pops from the beginning of\\na list is slow (because all of the other elements have to be shifted\\nby one).\\n\\nto implement a queue, use \"collections.deque\" which was designed to\\nhave fast appends and pops from both ends.  for example:\\n\\n   >>> from collections import deque\\n   >>> queue = deque([\"eric\", \"john\", \"michael\"])\\n   >>> queue.append(\"terry\")           # terry arrives\\n   >>> queue.append(\"graham\")          # graham arrives\\n   >>> queue.popleft()                 # the first to arrive now leaves\\n   \\'eric\\'\\n   >>> queue.popleft()                 # the second to arrive now leaves\\n   \\'john\\'\\n   >>> queue                           # remaining queue in order of arrival\\n   deque([\\'michael\\', \\'terry\\', \\'graham\\'])\\n\\n\\n5.1.3. list comprehensions\\n--------------------------\\n\\nlist comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. common\\napplications are to make new lists where each element is the result of\\nsome operations applied to each member of another sequence or\\niterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a\\ncertain condition.\\n\\nfor example, assume we want to create a list of squares, like:\\n\\n   >>> squares = []\\n   >>> for x in range(10):\\n   ...     squares.append(x**2)\\n   ...\\n   >>> squares\\n   [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]\\n\\nnote that this creates (or overwrites) a variable named \"x\" that still\\nexists after the loop completes.  we can calculate the list of squares\\nwithout any side effects using:\\n\\n   squares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, range(10)))\\n\\nor, equivalently:\\n\\n   squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\\n\\nwhich is more concise and readable.\\n\\na list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression\\nfollowed by a \"for\" clause, then zero or more \"for\" or \"if\" clauses.\\nthe result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression\\nin the context of the \"for\" and \"if\" clauses which follow it. for\\nexample, this listcomp combines the elements of two lists if they are\\nnot equal:\\n\\n   >>> [(x, y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y]\\n   [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]\\n\\nand it\\'s equivalent to:\\n\\n   >>> combs = []\\n   >>> for x in [1,2,3]:\\n   ...     for y in [3,1,4]:\\n   ...         if x != y:\\n   ...             combs.append((x, y))\\n   ...\\n   >>> combs\\n   [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]\\n\\nnote how the order of the \"for\" and \"if\" statements is the same in\\nboth these snippets.\\n\\nif the expression is a tuple (e.g. the \"(x, y)\" in the previous\\nexample), it must be parenthesized.\\n\\n   >>> vec = [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4]\\n   >>> # create a new list with the values doubled\\n   >>> [x*2 for x in vec]\\n   [-8, -4, 0, 4, 8]\\n   >>> # filter the list to exclude negative numbers\\n   >>> [x for x in vec if x >= 0]\\n   [0, 2, 4]\\n   >>> # apply a function to all the elements\\n   >>> [abs(x) for x in vec]\\n   [4, 2, 0, 2, 4]\\n   >>> # call a method on each element\\n   >>> freshfruit = [\\'  banana\\', \\'  loganberry \\', \\'passion fruit  \\']\\n   >>> [weapon.strip() for weapon in freshfruit]\\n   [\\'banana\\', \\'loganberry\\', \\'passion fruit\\']\\n   >>> # create a list of 2-tuples like (number, square)\\n   >>> [(x, x**2) for x in range(6)]\\n   [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), (5, 25)]\\n   >>> # the tuple must be parenthesized, otherwise an error is raised\\n   >>> [x, x**2 for x in range(6)]\\n     file \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\n       [x, x**2 for x in range(6)]\\n                  ^\\n   syntaxerror: invalid syntax\\n   >>> # flatten a list using a listcomp with two \\'for\\'\\n   >>> vec = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]\\n   >>> [num for elem in vec for num in elem]\\n   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\\n\\nlist comprehensions can contain complex expressions and nested\\nfunctions:\\n\\n   >>> from math import pi\\n   >>> [str(round(pi, i)) for i in range(1, 6)]\\n   [\\'3.1\\', \\'3.14\\', \\'3.142\\', \\'3.1416\\', \\'3.14159\\']\\n\\n\\n5.1.4. nested list comprehensions\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nthe initial expression in a list comprehension can be any arbitrary\\nexpression, including another list comprehension.\\n\\nconsider the following example of a 3x4 matrix implemented as a list\\nof 3 lists of length 4:\\n\\n   >>> matrix = [\\n   ...     [1, 2, 3, 4],\\n   ...     [5, 6, 7, 8],\\n   ...     [9, 10, 11, 12],\\n   ... ]\\n\\nthe following list comprehension will transpose rows and columns:\\n\\n   >>> [[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(4)]\\n   [[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]\\n\\nas we saw in the previous section, the nested listcomp is evaluated in\\nthe context of the \"for\" that follows it, so this example is\\nequivalent to:\\n\\n   >>> transposed = []\\n   >>> for i in range(4):\\n   ...     transposed.append([row[i] for row in matrix])\\n   ...\\n   >>> transposed\\n   [[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]\\n\\nwhich, in turn, is the same as:\\n\\n   >>> transposed = []\\n   >>> for i in range(4):\\n   ...     # the following 3 lines implement the nested listcomp\\n   ...     transposed_row = []\\n   ...     for row in matrix:\\n   ...         transposed_row.append(row[i])\\n   ...     transposed.append(transposed_row)\\n   ...\\n   >>> transposed\\n   [[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]\\n\\nin the real world, you should prefer built-in functions to complex\\nflow statements. the \"zip()\" function would do a great job for this\\nuse case:\\n\\n   >>> list(zip(*matrix))\\n   [(1, 5, 9), (2, 6, 10), (3, 7, 11), (4, 8, 12)]\\n\\nsee unpacking argument lists for details on the asterisk in this line.\\n\\n\\n5.2. the \"del\" statement\\n========================\\n\\nthere is a way to remove an item from a list given its index instead\\nof its value: the \"del\" statement.  this differs from the \"pop()\"\\nmethod which returns a value.  the \"del\" statement can also be used to\\nremove slices from a list or clear the entire list (which we did\\nearlier by assignment of an empty list to the slice).  for example:\\n\\n   >>> a = [-1, 1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5]\\n   >>> del a[0]\\n   >>> a\\n   [1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5]\\n   >>> del a[2:4]\\n   >>> a\\n   [1, 66.25, 1234.5]\\n   >>> del a[:]\\n   >>> a\\n   []\\n\\n\"del\" can also be used to delete entire variables:\\n\\n   >>> del a\\n\\nreferencing the name \"a\" hereafter is an error (at least until another\\nvalue is assigned to it).  we\\'ll find other uses for \"del\" later.\\n\\n\\n5.3. tuples and sequences\\n=========================\\n\\nwe saw that lists and strings have many common properties, such as\\nindexing and slicing operations.  they are two examples of *sequence*\\ndata types (see sequence types --- list, tuple, range).  since python\\nis an evolving language, other sequence data types may be added.\\nthere is also another standard sequence data type: the *tuple*.\\n\\na tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas, for\\ninstance:\\n\\n   >>> t = 12345, 54321, \\'hello!\\'\\n   >>> t[0]\\n   12345\\n   >>> t\\n   (12345, 54321, \\'hello!\\')\\n   >>> # tuples may be nested:\\n   ... u = t, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\\n   >>> u\\n   ((12345, 54321, \\'hello!\\'), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5))\\n   >>> # tuples are immutable:\\n   ... t[0] = 88888\\n   traceback (most recent call last):\\n     file \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\n   typeerror: \\'tuple\\' object does not support item assignment\\n   >>> # but they can contain mutable objects:\\n   ... v = ([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])\\n   >>> v\\n   ([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])\\n\\nas you see, on output tuples are always enclosed in parentheses, so\\nthat nested tuples are interpreted correctly; they may be input with\\nor without surrounding parentheses, although often parentheses are\\nnecessary anyway (if the tuple is part of a larger expression).  it is\\nnot possible to assign to the individual items of a tuple, however it\\nis possible to create tuples which contain mutable objects, such as\\nlists.\\n\\nthough tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in\\ndifferent situations and for different purposes. tuples are\\n*immutable*, and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of elements\\nthat are accessed via unpacking (see later in this section) or\\nindexing (or even by attribute in the case of \"namedtuples\"). lists\\nare *mutable*, and their elements are usually homogeneous and are\\naccessed by iterating over the list.\\n\\na special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1\\nitems: the syntax has some extra quirks to accommodate these.  empty\\ntuples are constructed by an empty pair of parentheses; a tuple with\\none item is constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not\\nsufficient to enclose a single value in parentheses). ugly, but\\neffective.  for example:\\n\\n   >>> empty = ()\\n   >>> singleton = \\'hello\\',    # <-- note trailing comma\\n   >>> len(empty)\\n   0\\n   >>> len(singleton)\\n   1\\n   >>> singleton\\n   (\\'hello\\',)\\n\\nthe statement \"t = 12345, 54321, \\'hello!\\'\" is an example of *tuple\\npacking*: the values \"12345\", \"54321\" and \"\\'hello!\\'\" are packed\\ntogether in a tuple. the reverse operation is also possible:\\n\\n   >>> x, y, z = t\\n\\nthis is called, appropriately enough, *sequence unpacking* and works\\nfor any sequence on the right-hand side.  sequence unpacking requires\\nthat there are as many variables on the left side of the equals sign\\nas there are elements in the sequence.  note that multiple assignment\\nis really just a combination of tuple packing and sequence unpacking.\\n\\n\\n5.4. sets\\n=========\\n\\npython also includes a data type for *sets*.  a set is an unordered\\ncollection with no duplicate elements.  basic uses include membership\\ntesting and eliminating duplicate entries.  set objects also support\\nmathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and\\nsymmetric difference.\\n\\ncurly braces or the \"set()\" function can be used to create sets.\\nnote: to create an empty set you have to use \"set()\", not \"{}\"; the\\nlatter creates an empty dictionary, a data structure that we discuss\\nin the next section.\\n\\nhere is a brief demonstration:\\n\\n   >>> basket = {\\'apple\\', \\'orange\\', \\'apple\\', \\'pear\\', \\'orange\\', \\'banana\\'}\\n   >>> print(basket)                      # show that duplicates have been removed\\n   {\\'orange\\', \\'banana\\', \\'pear\\', \\'apple\\'}\\n   >>> \\'orange\\' in basket                 # fast membership testing\\n   true\\n   >>> \\'crabgrass\\' in basket\\n   false\\n\\n   >>> # demonstrate set operations on unique letters from two words\\n   ...\\n   >>> a = set(\\'abracadabra\\')\\n   >>> b = set(\\'alacazam\\')\\n   >>> a                                  # unique letters in a\\n   {\\'a\\', \\'r\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\', \\'d\\'}\\n   >>> a - b                              # letters in a but not in b\\n   {\\'r\\', \\'d\\', \\'b\\'}\\n   >>> a | b                              # letters in a or b or both\\n   {\\'a\\', \\'c\\', \\'r\\', \\'d\\', \\'b\\', \\'m\\', \\'z\\', \\'l\\'}\\n   >>> a & b                              # letters in both a and b\\n   {\\'a\\', \\'c\\'}\\n   >>> a ^ b                              # letters in a or b but not both\\n   {\\'r\\', \\'d\\', \\'b\\', \\'m\\', \\'z\\', \\'l\\'}\\n\\nsimilarly to list comprehensions, set comprehensions are also\\nsupported:\\n\\n   >>> a = {x for x in \\'abracadabra\\' if x not in \\'abc\\'}\\n   >>> a\\n   {\\'r\\', \\'d\\'}\\n\\n\\n5.5. dictionaries\\n=================\\n\\nanother useful data type built into python is the *dictionary* (see\\nmapping types --- dict). dictionaries are sometimes found in other\\nlanguages as \"associative memories\" or \"associative arrays\".  unlike\\nsequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are\\nindexed by *keys*, which can be any immutable type; strings and\\nnumbers can always be keys.  tuples can be used as keys if they\\ncontain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any\\nmutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a\\nkey. you can\\'t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place\\nusing index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like \"append()\"\\nand \"extend()\".\\n\\nit is best to think of a dictionary as a set of *key: value* pairs,\\nwith the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary).\\na pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: \"{}\". placing a comma-\\nseparated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial\\nkey:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries\\nare written on output.\\n\\nthe main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key\\nand extracting the value given the key.  it is also possible to delete\\na key:value pair with \"del\". if you store using a key that is already\\nin use, the old value associated with that key is forgotten.  it is an\\nerror to extract a value using a non-existent key.\\n\\nperforming \"list(d)\" on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys\\nused in the dictionary, in insertion order (if you want it sorted,\\njust use \"sorted(d)\" instead). to check whether a single key is in the\\ndictionary, use the \"in\" keyword.\\n\\nhere is a small example using a dictionary:\\n\\n   >>> tel = {\\'jack\\': 4098, \\'sape\\': 4139}\\n   >>> tel[\\'guido\\'] = 4127\\n   >>> tel\\n   {\\'jack\\': 4098, \\'sape\\': 4139, \\'guido\\': 4127}\\n   >>> tel[\\'jack\\']\\n   4098\\n   >>> del tel[\\'sape\\']\\n   >>> tel[\\'irv\\'] = 4127\\n   >>> tel\\n   {\\'jack\\': 4098, \\'guido\\': 4127, \\'irv\\': 4127}\\n   >>> list(tel)\\n   [\\'jack\\', \\'guido\\', \\'irv\\']\\n   >>> sorted(tel)\\n   [\\'guido\\', \\'irv\\', \\'jack\\']\\n   >>> \\'guido\\' in tel\\n   true\\n   >>> \\'jack\\' not in tel\\n   false\\n\\nthe \"dict()\" constructor builds dictionaries directly from sequences\\nof key-value pairs:\\n\\n   >>> dict([(\\'sape\\', 4139), (\\'guido\\', 4127), (\\'jack\\', 4098)])\\n   {\\'sape\\': 4139, \\'guido\\': 4127, \\'jack\\': 4098}\\n\\nin addition, dict comprehensions can be used to create dictionaries\\nfrom arbitrary key and value expressions:\\n\\n   >>> {x: x**2 for x in (2, 4, 6)}\\n   {2: 4, 4: 16, 6: 36}\\n\\nwhen the keys are simple strings, it is sometimes easier to specify\\npairs using keyword arguments:\\n\\n   >>> dict(sape=4139, guido=4127, jack=4098)\\n   {\\'sape\\': 4139, \\'guido\\': 4127, \\'jack\\': 4098}\\n\\n\\n5.6. looping techniques\\n=======================\\n\\nwhen looping through dictionaries, the key and corresponding value can\\nbe retrieved at the same time using the \"items()\" method.\\n\\n   >>> knights = {\\'gallahad\\': \\'the pure\\', \\'robin\\': \\'the brave\\'}\\n   >>> for k, v in knights.items():\\n   ...     print(k, v)\\n   ...\\n   gallahad the pure\\n   robin the brave\\n\\nwhen looping through a sequence, the position index and corresponding\\nvalue can be retrieved at the same time using the \"enumerate()\"\\nfunction.\\n\\n   >>> for i, v in enumerate([\\'tic\\', \\'tac\\', \\'toe\\']):\\n   ...     print(i, v)\\n   ...\\n   0 tic\\n   1 tac\\n   2 toe\\n\\nto loop over two or more sequences at the same time, the entries can\\nbe paired with the \"zip()\" function.\\n\\n   >>> questions = [\\'name\\', \\'quest\\', \\'favorite color\\']\\n   >>> answers = [\\'lancelot\\', \\'the holy grail\\', \\'blue\\']\\n   >>> for q, a in zip(questions, answers):\\n   ...     print(\\'what is your {0}?  it is {1}.\\'.format(q, a))\\n   ...\\n   what is your name?  it is lancelot.\\n   what is your quest?  it is the holy grail.\\n   what is your favorite color?  it is blue.\\n\\nto loop over a sequence in reverse, first specify the sequence in a\\nforward direction and then call the \"reversed()\" function.\\n\\n   >>> for i in reversed(range(1, 10, 2)):\\n   ...     print(i)\\n   ...\\n   9\\n   7\\n   5\\n   3\\n   1\\n\\nto loop over a sequence in sorted order, use the \"sorted()\" function\\nwhich returns a new sorted list while leaving the source unaltered.\\n\\n   >>> basket = [\\'apple\\', \\'orange\\', \\'apple\\', \\'pear\\', \\'orange\\', \\'banana\\']\\n   >>> for i in sorted(basket):\\n   ...     print(i)\\n   ...\\n   apple\\n   apple\\n   banana\\n   orange\\n   orange\\n   pear\\n\\nusing \"set()\" on a sequence eliminates duplicate elements. the use of\\n\"sorted()\" in combination with \"set()\" over a sequence is an idiomatic\\nway to loop over unique elements of the sequence in sorted order.\\n\\n   >>> basket = [\\'apple\\', \\'orange\\', \\'apple\\', \\'pear\\', \\'orange\\', \\'banana\\']\\n   >>> for f in sorted(set(basket)):\\n   ...     print(f)\\n   ...\\n   apple\\n   banana\\n   orange\\n   pear\\n\\nit is sometimes tempting to change a list while you are looping over\\nit; however, it is often simpler and safer to create a new list\\ninstead.\\n\\n   >>> import math\\n   >>> raw_data = [56.2, float(\\'nan\\'), 51.7, 55.3, 52.5, float(\\'nan\\'), 47.8]\\n   >>> filtered_data = []\\n   >>> for value in raw_data:\\n   ...     if not math.isnan(value):\\n   ...         filtered_data.append(value)\\n   ...\\n   >>> filtered_data\\n   [56.2, 51.7, 55.3, 52.5, 47.8]\\n\\n\\n5.7. more on conditions\\n=======================\\n\\nthe conditions used in \"while\" and \"if\" statements can contain any\\noperators, not just comparisons.\\n\\nthe comparison operators \"in\" and \"not in\" are membership tests that\\ndetermine whether a value is in (or not in) a container.  the\\noperators \"is\" and \"is not\" compare whether two objects are really the\\nsame object.  all comparison operators have the same priority, which\\nis lower than that of all numerical operators.\\n\\ncomparisons can be chained.  for example, \"a < b == c\" tests whether\\n\"a\" is less than \"b\" and moreover \"b\" equals \"c\".\\n\\ncomparisons may be combined using the boolean operators \"and\" and\\n\"or\", and the outcome of a comparison (or of any other boolean\\nexpression) may be negated with \"not\".  these have lower priorities\\nthan comparison operators; between them, \"not\" has the highest\\npriority and \"or\" the lowest, so that \"a and not b or c\" is equivalent\\nto \"(a and (not b)) or c\". as always, parentheses can be used to\\nexpress the desired composition.\\n\\nthe boolean operators \"and\" and \"or\" are so-called *short-circuit*\\noperators: their arguments are evaluated from left to right, and\\nevaluation stops as soon as the outcome is determined.  for example,\\nif \"a\" and \"c\" are true but \"b\" is false, \"a and b and c\" does not\\nevaluate the expression \"c\".  when used as a general value and not as\\na boolean, the return value of a short-circuit operator is the last\\nevaluated argument.\\n\\nit is possible to assign the result of a comparison or other boolean\\nexpression to a variable.  for example,\\n\\n   >>> string1, string2, string3 = \\'\\', \\'trondheim\\', \\'hammer dance\\'\\n   >>> non_null = string1 or string2 or string3\\n   >>> non_null\\n   \\'trondheim\\'\\n\\nnote that in python, unlike c, assignment inside expressions must be\\ndone explicitly with the walrus operator \":=\". this avoids a common\\nclass of problems encountered in c programs: typing \"=\" in an\\nexpression when \"==\" was intended.\\n\\n\\n5.8. comparing sequences and other types\\n========================================\\n\\nsequence objects typically may be compared to other objects with the\\nsame sequence type. the comparison uses *lexicographical* ordering:\\nfirst the first two items are compared, and if they differ this\\ndetermines the outcome of the comparison; if they are equal, the next\\ntwo items are compared, and so on, until either sequence is exhausted.\\nif two items to be compared are themselves sequences of the same type,\\nthe lexicographical comparison is carried out recursively.  if all\\nitems of two sequences compare equal, the sequences are considered\\nequal. if one sequence is an initial sub-sequence of the other, the\\nshorter sequence is the smaller (lesser) one.  lexicographical\\nordering for strings uses the unicode code point number to order\\nindividual characters. some examples of comparisons between sequences\\nof the same type:\\n\\n   (1, 2, 3)              < (1, 2, 4)\\n   [1, 2, 3]              < [1, 2, 4]\\n   \\'abc\\' < \\'c\\' < \\'pascal\\' < \\'python\\'\\n   (1, 2, 3, 4)           < (1, 2, 4)\\n   (1, 2)                 < (1, 2, -1)\\n   (1, 2, 3)             == (1.0, 2.0, 3.0)\\n   (1, 2, (\\'aa\\', \\'ab\\'))   < (1, 2, (\\'abc\\', \\'a\\'), 4)\\n\\nnote that comparing objects of different types with \"<\" or \">\" is\\nlegal provided that the objects have appropriate comparison methods.\\nfor example, mixed numeric types are compared according to their\\nnumeric value, so 0 equals 0.0, etc.  otherwise, rather than providing\\nan arbitrary ordering, the interpreter will raise a \"typeerror\"\\nexception.\\n\\n-[ footnotes ]-\\n\\n[1] other languages may return the mutated object, which allows method\\n    chaining, such as \"d->insert(\"a\")->remove(\"b\")->sort();\".\\nthe python tutorial\\n*******************\\n\\npython is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. it has\\nefficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective\\napproach to object-oriented programming. python\\'s elegant syntax and\\ndynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal\\nlanguage for scripting and rapid application development in many areas\\non most platforms.\\n\\nthe python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely\\navailable in source or binary form for all major platforms from the\\npython web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely\\ndistributed. the same site also contains distributions

python interpreter and enter it again, the\\ndefinitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost.\\ntherefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are\\nbetter off using a text editor to prepare the input for the\\ninterpreter and running it with that file as input instead.  this is\\nknown as creating a *script*.  as your program gets longer, you may\\nwant to split it into several files for easier maintenance.  you may\\nalso want to use a handy function that you\\'ve written in several\\nprograms without copying its definition into each program.\\n\\nto support this, python has a way to put definitions in a file and use\\nthem in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter.\\nsuch a file is called a *module*; definitions from a module can be\\n*imported* into other modules or into the *main* module (the\\ncollection of variables that you have access to in a script executed\\nat the top level and in calculator mode).\\n\\na module is a file containing python definitions and statements.  the\\nfile name is the module name with the suffix \".py\" appended.  within a\\nmodule, the module\\'s name (as a string) is available as the value of\\nthe global variable \"__name__\".  for instance, use your favorite text\\neditor to create a file called \"fibo.py\" in the current directory with\\nthe following contents:\\n\\n   # fibonacci numbers module\\n\\n   def fib(n):    # write fibonacci series up to n\\n       a, b = 0, 1\\n       while a < n:\\n           print(a, end=\\' \\')\\n           a, b = b, a+b\\n       print()\\n\\n   def fib2(n):   # return fibonacci series up to n\\n       result = []\\n       a, b = 0, 1\\n       while a < n:\\n           result.append(a)\\n           a, b = b, a+b\\n       return result\\n\\nnow enter the python interpreter and import this module with the\\nfollowing command:\\n\\n   >>> import fibo\\n\\nthis does not enter the names of the functions defined in \"fibo\"\\ndirectly in the current symbol table; it only enters the module name\\n\"fibo\" there. using the module name you can access the functions:\\n\\n   >>> fibo.fib(1000)\\n   0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13

executable statements as well as function\\ndefinitions. these statements are intended to initialize the module.\\nthey are executed only the *first* time the module name is encountered\\nin an import statement. [1] (they are also run if the file is executed\\nas a script.)\\n\\neach module has its own private symbol table, which is used as the\\nglobal symbol table by all functions defined in the module. thus, the\\nauthor of a module can use global variables in the module without\\nworrying about accidental clashes with a user\\'s global variables. on\\nthe other hand, if you know what you are doing you can touch a\\nmodule\\'s global variables with the same notation used to refer to its\\nfunctions, \"modname.itemname\".\\n\\nmodules can import other modules.  it is customary but not required to\\nplace all \"import\" statements at the beginning of a module (or script,\\nfor that matter).  the imported module names are placed in the\\nimporting module\\'s global symbol table.\\n\\nthere is a variant of the \"import\" statement that imports names from a\\nmodule directly into the importing module\\'s symbol table.  for\\nexample:\\n\\n   >>> from fibo import fib, fib2\\n   >>> fib(500)\\n   0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\\n\\nthis does not introduce the module name from which the imports are\\ntaken in the local symbol table (so in the example, \"fibo\" is not\\ndefined).\\n\\nthere is even a variant to import all names that a module defines:\\n\\n   >>> from fibo import *\\n   >>> fib(500)\\n   0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\\n\\nthis imports all names except those beginning with an underscore\\n(\"_\"). in most cases python programmers do not use this facility since\\nit introduces an unknown set of names into the interpreter, possibly\\nhiding some things you have already defined.\\n\\nnote that in general the practice of importing \"*\" from a module or\\npackage is frowned upon, since it often causes poorly readable code.\\nhowever, it is okay to use it to save typing in interactive sessions.\\n\\nif the module name is followed by \"as\", then the name following \"as\"\\nis bound directly to the imported module.\\n\\n   >>> import fibo as fib\\n   >>> fib.fib(500)\\n   0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\\n\\nthis is effectively importing the module in the same way that \"import\\nfibo\" will do, with the only difference of it being available as\\n\"fib\".\\n\\nit can also be used when utilising \"from\" with similar effects:\\n\\n   >>> from fibo import fib as fibonacci\\n   >>> fibonacci(500)\\n   0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\\n\\nnote:\\n\\n  for efficiency reasons, each module is only imported once per\\n  interpreter session.  therefore, if you change your modules, you\\n  must restart the interpreter -- or, if it\\'s just one module you want\\n  to test interactively, use \"importlib.reload()\", e.g. \"import\\n  importlib; importlib.reload(modulename)\".\\n\\n\\n6.1.1. executing modules as scripts\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nwhen you run a python module with\\n\\n   python fibo.py <arguments>\\n\\nthe code in the module will be executed, just as if you imported it,\\nbut with the \"__name__\" set to \"\"__main__\"\".  that means that by\\nadding this code at the end of your module:\\n\\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\\n       import sys\\n       fib(int(sys.argv[1]))\\n\\nyou can make the file usable as a script as well as an importable\\nmodule, because the code that parses the command line only runs if the\\nmodule is executed as the \"main\" file:\\n\\n   $ python fibo.py 50\\n   0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34\\n\\nif the module is imported, the code is not run:\\n\\n   >>> import fibo\\n   >>>\\n\\nthis is often used either to provide a convenient user interface to a\\nmodule, or for testing purposes (running the module as a script\\nexecutes a test suite).\\n\\n\\n6.1.2. the module search path\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nwhen a module named \"spam\" is imported, the interpreter first searches\\nfor a built-in module with that name. if not found, it then searches\\nfor a file named \"spam.py\" in a list of directories given by the\\nvariable \"sys.path\".  \"sys.path\" is initialized from these locations:\\n\\n* the directory containing the input script (or the current directory\\n  when no file is specified).\\n\\n* \"pythonpath\" (a list of directory names, with the same syntax as the\\n  shell variable \"path\").\\n\\n* the installation-dependent default (by convention including a \"site-\\n  packages\" directory, handled by the \"site\" module).\\n\\nnote:\\n\\n  on file systems which support symlinks, the directory containing the\\n  input script is calculated after the symlink is followed. in other\\n  words the directory containing the symlink is **not** added to the\\n  module search path.\\n\\nafter initialization, python programs can modify \"sys.path\".  the\\ndirectory containing the script being run is placed at the beginning\\nof the search path, ahead of the standard library path. this means\\nthat scripts in that directory will be loaded instead of modules of\\nthe same name in the library directory. this is an error unless the\\nreplacement is intended.  see section standard modules for more\\ninformation.\\n\\n\\n6.1.3. \"compiled\" python files\\n------------------------------\\n\\nto speed up loading modules, python caches the compiled version of\\neach module in the \"__pycache__\" directory under the name\\n\"module.*version*.pyc\", where the version encodes the format of the\\ncompiled file; it generally contains the python version number.  for\\nexample, in cpython release 3.3 the compiled version of spam.py would\\nbe cached as \"__pycache__/spam.cpython-33.pyc\".  this naming\\nconvention allows compiled modules from different releases and\\ndifferent versions of python to coexist.\\n\\npython checks the modification date of the source against the compiled\\nversion to see if it\\'s out of date and needs to be recompiled.  this\\nis a completely automatic process.  also, the compiled modules are\\nplatform-independent, so the same library can be shared among systems\\nwith different architectures.\\n\\npython does not check the cache in two circumstances.  first, it\\nalways recompiles and does not store the result for the module that\\'s\\nloaded directly from the command line.  second, it does not check the\\ncache if there is no source module.  to support a non-source (compiled\\nonly) distribution, the compiled module must be in the source\\ndirectory, and there must not be a source module.\\n\\nsome tips for experts:\\n\\n* you can use the \"-o\" or \"-oo\" switches on the python command to\\n  reduce the size of a compiled module.  the \"-o\" switch removes\\n  assert statements, the \"-oo\" switch removes both assert statements\\n  and __doc__ strings.  since some programs may rely on having these\\n  available, you should only use this option if you know what you\\'re\\n  doing.  \"optimized\" modules have an \"opt-\" tag and are usually\\n  smaller.  future releases may change the effects of optimization.\\n\\n* a program doesn\\'t run any faster when it is read from a \".pyc\" file\\n  than when it is read from a \".py\" file; the only thing that\\'s faster\\n  about \".pyc\" files is the speed with which they are loaded.\\n\\n* the module \"compileall\" can create .pyc files for all modules in a\\n  directory.\\n\\n* there is more detail on this process, including a flow chart of the\\n  decisions, in **pep 3147**.\\n\\n\\n6.2. standard modules\\n=====================\\n\\npython comes with a library of standard modules, described in a\\nseparate document, the python library reference (\"library reference\"\\nhereafter).  some modules are built into the interpreter; these\\nprovide access to operations that are not part of the core of the\\nlanguage but are nevertheless built in, either for efficiency or to\\nprovide access to operating system primitives such as system calls.\\nthe set of such modules is a configuration option which also depends\\non the underlying platform.  for example, the \"winreg\" module is only\\nprovided on windows systems. one particular module deserves some\\nattention: \"sys\", which is built into every python interpreter.  the\\nvariables \"sys.ps1\" and \"sys.ps2\" define the strings used as primary\\nand secondary prompts:\\n\\n   >>> import sys\\n   >>> sys.ps1\\n   \\'>>> \\'\\n   >>> sys.ps2\\n   \\'... \\'\\n   >>> sys.ps1 = \\'c> \\'\\n   c> print(\\'yuck!\\')\\n   yuck!\\n   c>\\n\\nthese two variables are only defined if the interpreter is in\\ninteractive mode.\\n\\nthe variable \"sys.path\" is a list of strings that determines the\\ninterpreter\\'s search path for modules. it is initialized to a default\\npath taken from the environment variable \"pythonpath\", or from a\\nbuilt-in default if \"pythonpath\" is not set.  you can modify it using\\nstandard list operations:\\n\\n   >>> import sys\\n   >>> sys.path.append(\\'/ufs/guido/lib/python\\')\\n\\n\\n6.3. the \"dir()\" function\\n=========================\\n\\nthe built-in function \"dir()\" is used to find out which names a module\\ndefines.  it returns a sorted list of strings:\\n\\n   >>> import fibo, sys\\n   >>> dir(fibo)\\n   [\\'__name__\\', \\'fib\\', \\'fib2\\']\\n   >>> dir(sys)  \\n   [\\'__breakpointhook__\\',

packages\\n=============\\n\\npackages are a way of structuring python\\'s module namespace by using\\n\"dotted module names\".  for example, the module name \"a.b\" designates\\na submodule named \"b\" in a package named \"a\".  just like the use of\\nmodules saves the authors of different modules from having to worry\\nabout each other\\'s global variable names, the use of dotted module\\nnames saves the authors of multi-module packages like numpy or pillow\\nfrom having to worry about each other\\'s module names.\\n\\nsuppose you want to design a collection of modules (a \"package\") for\\nthe uniform handling of sound files and sound data.  there are many\\ndifferent sound file formats (usually recognized by their extension,\\nfor example: \".wav\", \".aiff\", \".au\"), so you may need to create and\\nmaintain a growing collection of modules for the conversion between\\nthe various file formats. there are also many different operations you\\nmight want to perform on sound data (such as mixing, adding echo,\\napplying an equalizer function, creating an artificial stereo effect),\\nso in addition you will be writing a never-ending stream of modules to\\nperform these operations.  here\\'s a possible structure for your\\npackage (expressed in terms of a hierarchical filesystem):\\n\\n   sound/                          top-level package\\n         __init__.py               initialize the sound package\\n         formats/                  subpackage for file format conversions\\n                 __init__.py\\n                 wavread.py\\n                 wavwrite.py\\n                 aiffread.py\\n                 aiffwrite.py\\n                 auread.py\\n                 auwrite.py\\n                 ...\\n         effects/                  subpackage for sound effects\\n                 __init__.py\\n                 echo.py\\n                 surround.py\\n                 reverse.py\\n                 ...\\n         filters/                  subpackage for filters\\n                 __init__.py\\n                 equalizer.py\\n                 vocoder.py\\n                 karaoke.py\\n                 ...\\n\\nwhen importing the package, python searches through the directories on\\n\"sys.path\" looking for the package subdirectory.\\n\\nthe \"__init__.py\" files are required to make python treat directories\\ncontaining the file as packages.  this prevents directories with a\\ncommon name, such as \"string\", unintentionally hiding valid modules\\nthat occur later on the module search path. in the simplest case,\\n\"__init__.py\" can just be an empty file, but it can also execute\\ninitialization code for the package or set the \"__all__\" variable,\\ndescribed later.\\n\\nusers of the package can import individual modules from the package,\\nfor example:\\n\\n   import sound.effects.echo\\n\\nthis loads the submodule \"sound.effects.echo\".  it must be referenced\\nwith its full name.\\n\\n   sound.effects.echo.echofilter(input, output, delay=0.7, atten=4)\\n\\nan alternative way of importing the submodule is:\\n\\n   from sound.effects import echo\\n\\nthis also loads the submodule \"echo\", and makes it available without\\nits package prefix, so it can be used as follows:\\n\\n   echo.echofilter(input, output, delay=0.7, atten=4)\\n\\nyet another variation is to import the desired function or variable\\ndirectly:\\n\\n   from sound.effects.echo import echofilter\\n\\nagain, this loads the submodule \"echo\", but this makes its function\\n\"echofilter()\" directly available:\\n\\n   echofilter(input, output, delay=0.7, atten=4)\\n\\nnote that when using \"from package import item\", the item can be\\neither a submodule (or subpackage) of the package, or some  other name\\ndefined in the package, like a function, class or variable.  the\\n\"import\" statement first tests whether the item is defined in the\\npackage; if not, it assumes it is a module and attempts to load it.\\nif it fails to find it, an \"importerror\" exception is raised.\\n\\ncontrarily, when using syntax like \"import item.subitem.subsubitem\",\\neach item except for the last must be a package; the last item can be\\na module or a package but can\\'t be a class or function or variable\\ndefined in the previous item.\\n\\n\\n6.4.1. importing * from a package\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nnow what happens when the user writes \"from sound.effects import *\"?\\nideally, one would hope that this somehow goes out to the filesystem,\\nfinds which submodules are present in the package, and imports them\\nall.  this could take a long time and importing sub-modules might have\\nunwanted side-effects that should only happen when the sub-module is\\nexplicitly imported.\\n\\nthe only solution is for the package author to provide an explicit\\nindex of the package.  the \"import\" statement uses the following\\nconvention: if a package\\'s \"__init__.py\" code defines a list named\\n\"__all__\", it is taken to be the list of module names that should be\\nimported when \"from package import *\" is encountered.  it is up to the\\npackage author to keep this list up-to-date when a new version of the\\npackage is released.  package authors may also decide not to support\\nit, if they don\\'t see a use for importing * from their package.  for\\nexample, the file \"sound/effects/__init__.py\" could contain the\\nfollowing code:\\n\\n   __all__ = [\"echo\", \"surround\", \"reverse\"]\\n\\nthis would mean that \"from sound.effects import *\" would import the\\nthree named submodules of the \"sound.effects\" package.\\n\\nif \"__all__\" is not defined, the statement \"from sound.effects import\\n*\" does *not* import all submodules from the package \"sound.effects\"\\ninto the current namespace; it only ensures that the package\\n\"sound.effects\" has been imported (possibly running any initialization\\ncode in \"__init__.py\") and then imports whatever names are defined in\\nthe package.  this includes any names defined (and submodules\\nexplicitly loaded) by \"__init__.py\".  it also includes any submodules\\nof the package that were explicitly loaded by previous \"import\"\\nstatements.  consider this code:\\n\\n   import sound.effects.echo\\n   import sound.effects.surround\\n   from sound.effects import *\\n\\nin this example, the \"echo\" and \"surround\" modules are imported in the\\ncurrent namespace because they are defined in the \"sound.effects\"\\npackage when the \"from...import\" statement is executed.  (this also\\nworks when \"__all__\" is defined.)\\n\\nalthough certain modules are designed to export only names that follow\\ncertain patterns when you use \"import *\", it is still considered bad\\npractice in production code.\\n\\nremember, there is nothing wrong with using \"from package import\\nspecific_submodule\"!  in fact, this is the recommended notation unless\\nthe importing module needs to use submodules with the same name from\\ndifferent packages.\\n\\n\\n6.4.2. intra-package references\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nwhen packages are structured into subpackages (as with the \"sound\"\\npackage in the example), you can use absolute imports to refer to\\nsubmodules of siblings packages.  for example, if the module\\n\"sound.filters.vocoder\" needs to use the \"echo\" module in the\\n\"sound.effects\" package, it can use \"from sound.effects import echo\".\\n\\nyou can also write relative imports, with the \"from module import\\nname\" form of import statement.  these imports use leading dots to\\nindicate the current and parent packages involved in the relative\\nimport.  from the \"surround\" module for example, you might use:\\n\\n   from . import echo\\n   from .. import formats\\n   from ..filters import equalizer\\n\\nnote that relative imports are based on the name of the current\\nmodule.  since the name of the main module is always \"\"__main__\"\",\\nmodules intended for use as the main module of a python application\\nmust always use absolute imports.\\n\\n\\n6.4.3. packages in multiple directories\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\npackages support one more special attribute, \"__path__\".  this is\\ninitialized to be a list containing the name of the directory holding\\nthe package\\'s \"__init__.py\" before the code in that file is executed.\\nthis variable can be modified; doing so affects future searches for\\nmodules and subpackages contained in the package.\\n\\nwhile this feature is not often needed, it can be used to extend the\\nset of modules found in a package.\\n\\n-[ footnotes ]-\\n\\n[1] in fact function definitions are also \\'statements\\' that are\\n    \\'executed\\'; the execution of a module-level function definition\\n    enters the function name in the module\\'s global symbol table.\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
